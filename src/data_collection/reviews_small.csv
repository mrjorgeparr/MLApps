0,"It may seem like harmless fun, but it really isn't","""Rock It!"" is a German 95-minute movie from 2010, so this one is also already over five years old. It was directed by Mike Marzuk and written by Peer Klehmet and Sebastian Wehlings and these three worked together on several other occasions as well. However, if you take a look at the other works by the, especially by the director, you can and should not be surprised how much of a failure this one here turned out to be. The cast includes some of Germany's rising stars, even today, like Schüle and Ehrich especially. Looking at the awards recognition, you also see Daniel Axt but honestly it seemed as if he never really managed a big breakthrough. Honestly, looking at his performance here, it is even shocking he received recognition for it. Anyway, this is the story of a girl who comes to a prestigious music school and has some time to prepare herself for a final test in which she needs to perform and convince the judges. It is also somewhat weak how this film somewhat includes casting show situations as something normal and appropriate, not just the final scene, but also when she wants to get into the rock band. Oh yeah, the girl did not know any rock music before. That's another plot point that really isn't working in the film's favor at all. But then again the worst aspect by far is probably what the film is trying to sell us as good music, namely generic bubble gum pop with zero depth and rock music with texts that have less meaning and depth than the Butterbrot you ate this morning. Shocking really. There are also some familiar faces to German film buffs I guess like Korittke, Profitlich and Nadolny, even if most of them don't have a great deal of runtime. Well.. what else can you say about this one. It also does not deliver in terms of romance because the characters, especially the young males are so shallow and never beyond the surface really. this film is a major disappointment, which is sending out all the wrong messages in terms of both music and film. Then again, like I already wrote, you cannot exactly be too surprised if you take a look at who made this. The stunning young female protagonists here are not enough to make up for the flaws with the story and 4 stars out of 10 is still very much on the generous side. I suggest you watch something else instead.",4
1,Amazing Film,"I've watched it every night for the last year. This truly is a masterpiece of a movie; for its time it's a wonder how they made it so good. I'm rating it 9 stars because I'd like more Mega Fat content to be honest but all in all great piece of cinematography. The actors did a wonderful job at their parts, Especially Remo Schulze and Jan Wannemacher as their parts in Mega Fat. Please make a sequel with more of a their content.",9
2,my favorite childhood movie,"I have seen this cartoon at the age of 6 or 7. It is a sequel to Cudesna Suma (English Title: The Elm Chanted Forest). Despite the popularity of the first one, the sequel never became quite so recognized by audiences. However, despite the better production, The Magician's Hat is and always will be my favorite. It is a movie I grew up with and I know it by heart. It wonderfully portrays the lives of the mystical and imaginary characters - the inhabitants of the Magic/Enchanted Forest which is under attack. Now, the creatures of the forest must fight the evil forces. It is something I would recommend to all regardless of their age and whereabouts for it is a cartoon worth seeing.",10
3,One of the rarest and best foreign animated films.,"I'm not much on magicians, but Thistle is pretty adorable. I love this film next to Disney's Bongo because of the animated romance. It's just so ""O.M.G."" warm. Too bad this never came out in the U.S.. But for the record, I'm glad this is the only version known to exist because, seriously, if this was dubbed is English, it would be really crappy and clumsy, like the English dubbed version ""The Elm-Chanted Forest"". It wasn't nearly as good as the original Croatian version. Especially ""Hurray for Betty Boop"", which was actually animated Betty Boop shorts combined together into a full length movie with poorly written script and it was totally badly criticized, in which it was never released on newer VHS. and DVDs (it was only released once on VHS back in the mid 1980s), possibly never seen again when the 1980s died. Even the Super Mario Bros. anime movie is better left in Japanese. The original is always best, even if I don't understand foreign language.",10
4,Just another crazy hitchhiker movie,"This movie is watchable, but nothing special. Four girls on a road trip to Vegas foolishly decide to pick up a hitchhiker (because he is cute). They all end up staying the night at a motel in the middle of nowhere, and the hitchhiker's psychotic issues with women become apparent.The characters are clichés--there is a married, responsible woman; a slutty party girl; an unsure bride-to-be; and a man-hater who just got dumped. The hitchhiker is genuinely nice until he goes crazy.There's not nearly enough gore, and way too much rape. I enjoy slasher horror/thrillers a lot, and this one did nothing for me. The ending was just as lame as the rest of the movie.On the positive side, the actors did a great job with that they had to work with. The dialogue isn't awful, and overall I was impressed with the cast, having never seen or heard of any of them before. And the plot wasn't out of the realm of possibility (although I really doubt any woman in this day and age would pick up a hitchhiker--no matter how attractive he is), so I wasn't groaning that things didn't make sense.Overall, ""The Hitchhiker"" was well-acted and made sense, but wasn't very interesting. There are a lot of better movies in the same genre that I would recommend over this one (""Rest Stop,"" ""The Devil's Rejects,"" ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" even ""The Hitcher"" remake). Do yourself a favor and skip it unless you don't have any other options.",4
5,Believable? No way.,"About the spoiler warning? It's not ""may contain"", it -does- contain spoilers. Readers beware. Okay, first I need it to be known that I'm not bashing the actors. They're just working with what they're given. The problem was the script. It was horrendous. There was NOTHING believable about it at all. Sure, when you have a movie based on a murderous hitchhiker, there's going to be the bad mistake here and there that puts you in the terribly horrific, movie-worthy situation. But these girls just made stupid decision after stupid decision. The only girl smart enough to ever try and call the police was the girl added towards the end because he'd already killed one and hit another with a car. Speaking of hitting her with a car...why the hell did she try and outrun a truck rather than run to the side like a normal person? Also, does the one who wrote the script honest to god believe cops are not going to investigate a door covered in blood? Frankly, it wasn't suspenseful either. The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were. Well, this rant has gone on way longer than I meant to for such a bad movie, so I won't bother to touch on the end besides the fact it's unrealistic and lame.",2
6,"For The Asylum, it's not too bad but is still lacking in a number of areas","When I saw that The Hitchhiker was made by The Asylum, I immediately thought ""Oh no, here we go again"". But I watched it to give it a benefit of the doubt, and while for The Asylum it is not so bad The Hitchhiker is still lacking in a lot of areas. I'll give it some credit, Jeff Denton is quite good as the villain and it is not too cheap visually having some decent scenery and effects and the editing is not as choppy as feared. On the other hand, the dialogue is horrendously bad, the characters are undeveloped clichés and the story is painfully predictable and severely lacking in any kind of suspense. The rapes and gore are nowhere near harrowing enough, with too much of the former and not enough of the latter. The ending is far too jumpy and rushed and doesn't feel rounded off satisfactorily. Apart from Denton, the acting is poor, I didn't get any sense of terror from either of the women. So on the whole, lacking but a marginal improvement on the general standard of Asylum's movies. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4
7,if you've got nothing better to do...,"First, the current IMDb plot description seems to be misleading, the movie is about a group of girls who pick up a misogynistic hitchhiker, who plans to kill them all. They stop at a small motel, where he holds them hostage, but develops an intense attraction for one of the girls. Violence ensues.I picked this up by mistake thinking it was the other 2007 movie ""The Hitcher"". Not that The Hitcher is any better, and I was looking for a crummy movie to watch anyway, but this was almost unbearable at times. I think I could have vomited on a piece of paper and come up with a better plot than this.I can't even count how many movies I've seen with virtually the same storyline, so this was almost painfully predictable at times, but what really made it awful were a few scenes that ... well let me give an example. At one point a door is covered in (what is very obviously) blood, and two police officers, at the scene because of a 911 call, are looking at it from 30 feet away, see a man, also covered in blood, walk out of the door, agree that it looks suspicious, but decide to not investigate further.But, however ridiculous it may be, the movie was never boring, was well produced, directed, and acted, complete with good special effects, gratuitous nudity, and violence. I probably would not recommend actually spending 90 minutes of your life sitting down to watch this movie, but it turned out to be perfect to have on while I cleaned my basement. Also highly recommended for fans of crummy movies, and would be a good movie to watch with friends when you plan on doing more talking than watching.",4
8,"If You Can Forgive a Few Holes in the Plot, This is Worth Watching","I'm sure this film will get scathing reviews, but I actually found it to be quite tense, scary and disturbing. As much as you'd like to rip it apart at times for what it doesn't deliver, it does deliver enough to keep you glued to that screen the entire time, just like the box promises. The hell with Jason, Freddie, Michael Myers and the others; the scariest monster is the average guy-next-door that appears nice on the surface, then slowly morphs into a fearsome psychotic. Jeff Denton did an admirable job as this particular ""nice-guy"" killer, and he was pretty darned believable. Even though the girls were obviously not professional actresses, they managed to deliver worthy performances in these roles, adding to the dreaded atmosphere. The dumb-cop segment was pretty far-fetched, but like I said, it can be forgiven in favor of the unsettling mood this movie created. As soon as I saw that plastic-lined motel room, I knew this was going to get brutal. Call me a sadist, but I just really love this type of movie. 8 stars.",8
9,Another Green lighted awful flick!,"OK I went to this website before I watched this movie, read the comments, got pumped, - cause they where all pretty good for a B-flick - watched it and was completely disappointed. The main characters wannabe lone rebel straight out of the mid-west act was sickening to the stomach, and don't even get me started on the two cops, I mean there's a bloody door right there in plain view, check it out! The plot was completely predictable, the editing was rather limited, I swear the editor was even dozing off near the end when he was cutting this movie, and the direction was clouded by bad cinematography. Now please don't get me wrong, I love B-flicks, some are really good.Want to watch a good B rated flick???Dave recommends"" High Tension ""http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/",1
10,No.,"This is total swill. If you take The Devil's Rejects and suck all the good out of it, and add a lot of twisted, kinky bondage parts, a few rape scenes, and like one or two sincerely horrifying scenes, and you'd get this movie. People are calling this a ripoff of '86's The Hitcher, but I don't see that at all. Even the worst Hitcher ripoffs are still better than this. The main problem on display here is that there's really nothing here besides a few of the director's fetishes being showcased like circus exhibits. Is all you need out of a movie shots of girls being abused and tied up, cowering in fear? Well, then rent this movie!However, I'd rather just watch a good movie, which this is clearly not. The sad thing is, there are some really good thrills waiting to be uncovered here, but only a few. For instance, the suspense at the beginning before the bondage nonsense started...pretty damn good if you ask me. And the scene where the hitchhiker kills the nympho girl (can't remember names) is chilling, very brutal in a way, challenging even The Devil's Rejects for unbridled fury. How come the rest of the movie can't be that good? Huh? I really need to stop renting stupid crap like this. Closing message: Just let this gutter trash die and forget it forever. Not recommended.",2
11,Switched from thriller R movie to made-for-TV movie of the week,This movie was disappointing for at least one of two reasons. The suspense created disappeared because of horrible acting or lack of direction from the director.. I don't know.. it was like a tasty bubble gum that seemed to run out of flavor yet you continue to chew on it because it once tasted great. Like most thrillers The Hitchhiker had promise yet failed to deliver when it had me bright eyed and ready to turn the volume down(I was watching the movie alone.. in the dark) This so called thriller simply came apart like it was made of Lego transforming into something else. It simply ran out of gas and left me staring at a made-for-TV-like style movie with one exception.. it was probably rated-R.,1
12,"do not rent,buy or even download for free",This Movie was the Absolute Worst movie i ever seen i lost all interest when the four girls had 2 chances to kill him and did not i don't care i see people saying oh well you know its not easy to kill some1 Na F that if some1 plan was to kill you and you have the chance to kill them you better go for it. and the 2 stupid cops was another epic fail and due to the fact i don't have enough lines i will copy and paste what i just said This Movie was the Absolute Worst movie i ever seen i lost all interest when the four girls had 2 chances to kill him and did not i don't care i see people saying oh well you know its not easy to kill some1 Na F that if some1 plan was to kill you and you have the chance to kill them you better go for it. and the 2 stupid cops was another epic fail and due to the fact i don't have enough lines i will copy and paste what i just said and me saying this twice means I'm twice upset,1
13,Funny...because acting is so very bad,"The scariest part of this movie is that I am actually taking time out of my day to comment on it. I could be doing something much more productive, like cleaning out my sock drawer. The characters in this movie are beyond stupid to the point you just don't care for them. You can easily find yourself rooting for the main antagonist, ""Rollin' Commando"" Jeff Denton,who himself, comes across like a hipster dufus. This villain is as terrifying as a poodle with the runs. If you had the choice of watching this movie, watching the grass grow, or watching paint dry....then by all means, watch this movie. Grass growing or paint drying aside, I'm sure you could find something to do much more worthy of your time. This movie, however, is not without merit. You could easily use the DVD as a coffee table coaster....or even use it for skeet shooting.",4
14,I don't care what you all think! This is a pretty entertaining low budget picture!,"The Asylum and Leigh Scott get a lot of heat from a lot of people over these films meant to capitalize on big studio productions. The low numbers for The Hitchhiker kind of surprise me though, as I think that it's actually better than the movie it supposedly imitates, the dismal remake of The Hitcher. It makes me wonder if any of the people voting this down even watched it. If this were made in the seventies it would probably be a cult classic right now instead of an object of ridicule.Asylum contract star Jeff Denton gives a pretty good performance as the title madman terrorizing women in his plastic wrapped motel room. He's soft spoken, yet menacing and violent. The girls are all three-dimensional and the actresses that play them are decent enough too.Unlike The Hitcher remake, it takes chances by actually having really unpredictable and violent things happen to some of it's female characters. It's sort of surprising which ones survive and which ones don't.There's one thing I didn't like however, I believe that the film should have climaxed on the dusty Utah road instead of jumping foreword in time several weeks to the main protagonist's house. It kind of robbed the ending of some of it's excitement.",8
15,"JAMES DEAN as a serial killer,Maybe ?","Hitchhiker theasylum's (theasylum.cc) Starring Jeff Denton (interviewed), Shaley Scott( soon to be interviewed). Leigh Scott ( writer & director) brings us his version of the someone who you need to pass by and not stop for. This movie was scary and suspenseful. That said , It has some ugly moments with sheer violence and sending the wrong message towards female abuse. Denton plays the bad guy and has major problems with women, Jeff has played flaming genteels(Pirates Of Treasure Island) and good guys( Beast of Bray Road),This time NOT NICE !We have labeled Denton with JAMES DEAN look, This film is something DEAN may have tried if time and car error had been kinder. Shaley Scott , Is known for her singing and this film proves she can act too. We felt she was really given a opportunity to shine and that is very rare for your first effort on screen with lines. She is also featured on the box art, Which again is quite a kudo. The violence is very real seeming, Especially the gun play has a gritty hurt- producing effect. The ending is questionable for effect, I hate red herring stuff, But the female hero made it all work .",5
16,"The story is believable, Awesome movie!!","Wow. I don't know if i was just in a mood or what but this movie scared the crap out of me. The tag line on the DVD cover is ""you will never take your eyes off the screen"" and it was correct. I was glued to the TV from beginning to end, tensing up, closing my eyes but still watching, I had to use the bathroom, but i refused to pause it. The plot is so real, that is why it scared me. The acting isn't bad, not for a B horror film, the cinematography could have been better, but i have seen much worse. The movie only runs 90 minutes, but i swear it seemed longer because i was enthralled in the story. It's your average hitchhiker story, except the hitchhiker, he's nice looking, you like him even though you know he's a bad person. I have never seen any of these actors and actresses before but I think they did a great job. I do not know why something like ""The Hitcher"" gets in theaters but something actually good, like this movie is thrown to DVD, other than the fact that it is extremely graphic and the teeny bloopers wouldn't be able to watch it. I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to everyone. 4 out of 4.The DVD is unrated, but there is scenes of rape, language, severe violence, sexual situations other than rape. 90 minutes",10
17,No direction,"All 4 of these women were stupid and slutty. The writer did not even give us a rooting interest for any of these women. They were out of the situation and then went back and did not kill or at the very least frisk the killer for weapons, after one saw the hotel clerk was shot. This was just sloppily done. Not one of the characters even tried a cell phone. This was ridiculous and badly acted. This movie had so many loose ends and evidence staring the viewer in the face with 'Keystone' cops, unable to figure it out. 4 ladies going to Vegas and one of them decides to be like a man and just hop in bed with the killer,before they knew he was a killer, but still. Of course , You had the shallow girl talk of 'size' etc. This was just a bad movie and I give it a 3 based on some action here and there.",3
18,Not bad.,"What impressed me most about The Hitchhiker is that the story unfolds in a logical way. Jack is pretty sick, and he becomes more and more desperate as the situation gets out of his control.Jeff Denton does a good job as the killer. He's good looking and charming enough at first. So it's not hard to believe the women would trust him enough to drive him down the road a few miles, it's 4 against 1 after all. As things go south for him he plays the character as more desperate than over the top evil. A nice change for the genre.The 4 women played by Sarah Lieving, Shaley Scott, Sarah Hall, and Jessica Bork, are likable enough that you sympathize with their ordeal. There is some pretty brutal violence these women go through that I didn't care for. At the same time I knew what I was getting into when I sat down to watch it. Fans of movies like Saw will find this tame.So to sum up. Decent performances, decent script, not for kids. Though I probably wouldn't watch it again, it's not bad for a low budget movie.",4
19,Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!,"Though the movie is brilliant in the beginning, do not let it fool you. this movies contains much sexual abuse and you will certainly be left wishing you never knew it exist. The sexual scenes within the film last for at least 40% of the film. Yuck! I need to clean my brain and my eyes. I will never trust a movie filled with crazy girls again X_XThe idea would have been great, but it was ruined by the abuse and disregard for the girls; not to mention they themselves lacked personal respect. I couldn't finish the film after running into nudity, I literally felt like throwing up after seeing this.Save your time and find something better! :D",1
20,not brilliant but not bad at all.....,"Woodstock villa.....the title seems promising especially for a thriller. but the movie does not live up to the interest it created initially. i agree with a fellow commentator that if this was made a short film of around 10-15 minutes, the impact would be much better. the story is not worthy of a lengthy film but anyways i did not find it totally bad at all. one thing that works in the favor of this movie is sikander kher....the guy has a talent inherited from his parents (Anupam and kiron kher). i wont say the twists were unpredictable but nevertheless overall its a watchable movie... not highly recommended but worth a one time watch, if only for sikander..",5
21,"A thriller that will shock, thrill and surprise the audience. (Minor Spoilers)","The title ""Woodstock Villa"" is a bit odd for a Bollywood movie and I did not know what it is. My best guess is that it is a name of a place and I was right. The story focuses on Samir (Sikander Kher), an unemployed Punjabi boy. Street-smart, Samir has a weakness for beautiful women, easily falling in love with them. So it's not very difficult to imagine Samir falling for Zara's charms. But what makes Zara even more attractive is her proposal  asking him to kidnap her. But little does he know that he is being trapped in a web that is going to change his life forever! Samir needs answers before he gets sucked further in the whirlpool he has created. Beautiful and seductive, Zara (Neha Oberoi) is a charming and wonderful wife in husband Jatin's (Arbaz Khan) eyes. But she can also be totally wild when on her own. Changing personalities on a whim, Zara plans her own abduction to test her husband's love.Jatin is a rich, suave businessman of few words. He zealously guards his social position and values the respect he enjoys from his peers and the media. He also loves his wife Zara. But after her abduction he fears the worst. Is it was too late to express all the feelings he nurtured for her? So when Jatin's wife disappears, a hostile and taunting ransom demand follows. As the true nature of the stakes (for the captor and his captives) are revealed, Woodstock Villa slowly transforms from a film noire into a chilling and shocking thriller. Woodstock Villa is contemporary entertainment that breaks new grounds in Bollywood film-making with every clever twist.Directed by Hansal Mehta, it is a compelling film about swiftly changing moralities in today's world. The film introduces Sikander Kher (son of Anupam Kher). Much loved Bollywood actor, Sanjay Dutt makes a special appearance in a song and dance sequence, while Shakti Kapoor provide able support. Music is pretty good composed by Anu Malik and the best song is Dhoka. The only downside of the film is that it has a bit of dodgy screenplay (which is the story put onto screen), which can be a bit difficult to understand the story but if you listen to every word they say and think hard then you will be able to understand. Overall it is a good and intelligent thriller.",8
22,Very Very Average!,"I saw this movie only because it was a White Feather Production whose previous film Dus Kahaneeyain was a good film(considering all ten stories). It's coming up with new ideas which have never been applied in Bollywood, plus 'The Great Indian Butterfly' and 'Pankh' also look very good in the trailers.But this film was really a disappointment, the new actor Sikander Kher, son of Anupam Kher really dint act well nor did any one else and even the soundtrack is pathetic. The only reason that one can sit through the film is because it's not slow and second that the storyline is not all that bad, mildly predictable but bearable.",4
23,Never waste your money on such a horrible flick!,"With this one ""Bollywood"" has once again proved it keeps on wasting lacs of money to introduce youngsters who can't act, can't dance, don't even look good and most unluckily aren't backed up by good storyline. I went to the theater with lot of expectations from Sikandar(Unfortunately I never saw him in the newspaper, magazines) who is related from the family of great names like Anupam Kher and Kirron Kher. In the end I could only say if you don't have a good face for Hindi movies you must know how to act and how to dance (Unfortunately, my dear, Sikandar, you know nothing of them!!). The whole story is based on a kidnap/murder, which is rather comical than being a thriller. The music scores are pathetic and I must add the songs are not required in the movie at all. And specifically I just don't want to discuss about the storyline because there wasn't any real story behind, it's all real CRAP!",1
24,What a joke!!,"Unbelievably stupid amateur effort.Complete waste of time. Of the 10 people in this theatre in London tonight where I watched it, half walked out midway through the film. I hung around thinking surely things would improve since the plot and direction had hit rock bottom....and how wrong was I...they kept digging. Songs are pointless except one catchy tune. All the songs are out of place though.Film's plot is embarrassingly stupid. The director has gone overboard trying to make this a classy project. The production team must be living on a different planet to think that this movie has anything good to offer. I am so upset wasting my time that I would term this film as a real TRASH. The direction is AWFUL!! Real amateur. A smart kid can do a better job with directing this. 'White Feather Films' - I'll be wary of them henceforth. GUYS STAY WELL AWAY!!!!!!!!",1
25,Disappointing,"Only one word - it was a disappointment. I read some reviews about the movie and someone compared it to johnny gaddar so I was really looking forward to this one. The movie is unexpectedly short. Direction, screenplay is good and so is Sikandar Kher and Neha Uberoi. Its a stylish flick from white feathers but Sikandar deserved a better debut.I think the movie started really well, picked up good pace but loses pace in the middle. There are 3 songs that are so unwanted and annoying. Sanjay Dutt cameo song is good but again they could have just kept it in titles and not made a part of the movie. Both Gulshan Grover's and Shakti Kapoor's characters are added to fill the space. All in all, the story line is really short for a movie. I thought this could be the 11th story that Sanjay Gupta could not fit in Dus Kahaniyaan. If this was made as a 10 min story, it would have been really a good short story.Do you know what is even worst? Even the story that I felt was so short - is not original. Its a copy of 1958 classic Vertigo.",5
26,Not a bad start...,"Sikander is new, and so is Neha. We gotta take it a bit easy on them, come on people. Sikander didn't act bad, and neither did Neha! Of course it's a different thing than Arbaaz Khan doesn't know acting... The storyline wasn't bad...but the soundtrack was humiliating, no doubt. Woodstock Villa, the opening of Sikander and Neha to Bollywood, is, overall, a treat to the eye and the ear. The small twists were little bit expected, but the overall effect was surprising still. If you take my opinion, then if you like movies which pass your time easily, and have a bit of thrill and suspense in them, then go for it. A brilliant cinematography, choreography, beautiful editing and a good production and direction will leave a good impression. The strategy of the whole storyline is good. 6/10 - not a bad start for both the newbies. After all, Times of India gave it a *** and a half...Can't be that bad can it, when Jannat and Bhoothnath got a ** and a half each? Hoping for something better from both next time. Nice try Hansal. Not a bad shot.",8
27,Too much style,"Sanjay Gupta is known for stylish films but at times style overpowers content, WOODSTOCK VILLA is one such film, the film is short in length but has more style and slow motion then a TV serial. The film has an interesting plot and good twists and turns which sometimes are irrational though yet it works at times however the problem is predictability and overdose of styleDirection is decent Music is okaySikander Kher in his debut is raw but does well in some scenes, yet his voice is a distraction and also his presence, Arbaaz Khan is okay Neha Oberoi is okay rest are okay",4
28,Debutant Sikander Kher delivers a confident performance,"The best thing about director Hansal Mehta's Woodstock Villa is that it's only about an hour and a half long. And for the first hour and fifteen minutes, nobody knows what's going on in the film. Nobody but the characters in the film, I presume.Sitting there in my seat I felt like I was being repeatedly stabbed in the eye, blinded by the saturated tones, the zip-zap editing, the crazy camera angles and generally by the filmmaker's irritating attempt to show off with stylish technical gimmickry. How you wish he'd paid as much attention to his wafer-thin plot.Without going into too many details, let me just say the film centres around the kidnapping of a successful businessman's wife and the ransom demand that follows. The kidnapper, one later discovers, may not be calling the shots in this operation after all. Woodstock Villa is one of those films where nothing is what it seems, it's a story of cheating spouses, double-crosses and mistaken identities. Constructed from a screenplay that's full of little holes, the film trades common sense for convenience. And as a result, you find yourself gasping in disbelief at the half-dozen or so slip-ups in the plot. It's the kind of film where cops talk in riddles, and Sanjay Dutt pops up in a pop song for no reason at all. It's the kind of film that thinks adultery and murder are the most lethal ingredients for a tight thriller.On the upside, debutant Sikander Kher delivers a confident performance as a morally questionable lothario caught in a web of deceit. He has an engaging presence and impressive dialogue delivery. Now if only he'd chop those long tresses and take a nice, clean shower. His co-star newcomer Neha Uberoi is easy on the eye, and fortunately is not expected to perform any acting histrionics. Arbaaz Khan, as the businessman whose wife goes missing, turns in a competent performance. Much like Rise and Fall, the short film he co-directed with Sanjay Gupta for that anthology of shorts Dus Kahaniyaan, Hansal Mehta's Woodstock Villa too suffers from the same disease - it's all style and little substance.Watch if you have time to spare, it's not a film I can recommend strongly",3
29,"A movie with ""wooden"" performances, not worth ""stocking"" and obviously not seeing!!!","I'd too much expectation from this one, but it turned out to be a real letdown and the most tragic experience. The plot has been frequented and the execution could only have made the difference. Considering that director is Hansal Mehta (dir of ""CHHAL"" which wasn't outstanding, but nevertheless, was far satisfying than expected), I felt that though the plot isn't fresh, the execution will be effective and make the movie worth watching. But again, I was wrong. It's been handled in the worst way it could have ever been. All the songs were totally unnecessary and were purely intended to extend the duration of the movie, since a movie needs to be more than just an hour. Otherwise, the topic fitted the best for a TV series episode {I remember having watched many TV episodes with same plot, however can remember only one series name for now and that's ""SURAAG"" (produced by Adhikari Brothers; Sudesh Berry playing the lead role) and ""APRADHI KAUN"" with Ashutosh Rana playing lead role}. With the director and script at their worst, most of the actors too tried to match up with them and delivered their worst performance ever (especially Sachin Khedekar). I can't understand why Sikandar (Kher) chose to begin his career with such a disastrous movie script. Anyways, his acting suited his choice, it was also as worst as the movie, if not more!!! There's no point in discussing Neha Uberoi, Arbaaz Khan and others' performances.If you haven't watched this movie as yet, you're quite lucky and do yourself a favor by not even considering to watch it. Save yourself from a tragic experience by skipping Woodstock Villa, a movie which truly deserves to be in a trash box.",1
30,Against Sanity and Logic,A loose story with twists which though intended to bring out awe and thrill instead just ends up disgusting the audience with a senseless and illogical plot. It all starts with a business man played by Arbaaz Khan getting a call from a kidnapper demanding a ransom of 50 lakhs to free his wife . Later revealed that it was a setup by his wife to test the loyalty of his husband planned with a protagonist played by Kher who she befriends in a bar . Seems to be an ordinary story until the time all those twists are un-curtained which sound way to far fetched and completely put off the audience off to an extent level that you just want to leave the movie midway.,3
31,What is the point of this film?,"What on earth is the point of this movie? If someone could explain to me why this film was made, then I would really like to meet you. I'll admit that the camera quality was nice, though. But there were lots of audio inconsistencies, and man oh man, does this story drag along at the pace of a hungover turtle. But what IS the story? And what is the point? The only thing that made the film watchable were a few of the actors who made the best out of a rather weak script. I just think it could have been a lot better had more attention to detail been given from the start. Give us a good story, a good script, and well-written characters. Then maybe it would be something worth watching. If you love making films, then keep working at it. But better luck next time.",1
32,Yawn...,"Happened to take a look at this film from a friend of a friend. But I'm not sure we'll still be friends after they made me sit and watch this thing. I will never get those minutes of my life back! What was the director trying to say with this film? Does it have a purpose? Really flat dialogue, poorly-written characters, the list goes on. I wanted to care about the characters and get involved in their story, but there was barely even a story at all. It seems like maybe it was made just to crack up the crew. I can't imagine any other reason for putting this film together. I could tell that the actors were really trying to make it work, but the whole project just really falls short.",1
33,Great Movie!,"I recently saw Comic Day and I really liked it! The cussing was a bit too much but all around it was a great movie. It was very well acted, and I wish it were even longer. Steve Summers and Josh Gilpatrick were hilarious and perfectly cast! Todd Taylor was perfect as Holden. I was laughing out loud during the scene where is at the drive through. Soshi was a very funny thug too. The kids were also very good! I'd recommend this movie to everyone!",8
34,Funny!,No doubt that Haynes and his crew did the superb job making this master piece out of the limited budget.  All the main characters in the comic book store and its strange shoppers are all funny as hell.  Highly recommend this movie.,10
35,"""I Am Vengeance: Retaliation."" - Plenty of action.","It's obviously a very cheaply made movie, but it's redeeming feature
is that there are plenty of fights, hand to hand - and two badazz girls
who can (and do) take on anybody.The story? Not much, find a guy and bring him in.As long as you don't expect Hollywood gloss, this is almost like a low-budget
""Expendables,"" with plenty of action and enough firepower to fight a war.
There is also some witty banter and funny one-liners. I rate it a 5/10.",5
36,WHAT A SHOCKER!!,"So bad it's hilarious. Acting is dreadful, dialogue is terrible!! We started it and decided to finish watching sadly because we don't give up.",1
37,Just keep going to another movie.,"STOP WRITING FAKE 9 & 10 STAR REVIEWS FOR A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!I tried watching this movie and am turning it off while I type this review. I spent the first 10 minutes watching the movie, the next 15 minutes reading the reviews and these 2-3 minutes doing the review.The acting is terrible, the shootouts are laughable (nobody gets hit) and many times, you can see they don't actually land any of the punches when fighting.Who cares about the plot because it doesn't generally matter in action movies... but yea, the plot is pretty worthless and doesn't help the movie at all.I give it 2 stars because they at least knew how to turn on the cameras and film the scenes.",2
38,Wow,"I expected it to be underwhelming, but this was definitely below my expectations. Lots of fighting, thousands of rounds expended, and nobody really gets hurt.",1
39,Worse than the original.,"I really like Stu Bennett, he's very likeable and a great badass. This movie, however, is a major step down from the first one.Instead of continuing on with John as a lone wolf, very particular and focused (which fit him very well), this movie gave us a bunch of mediocre, cliche characters who took up a lot of screen time that should have gone to John.The two girls had some surprisingly good fight moves, but I still would have preferred the movie without so many side characters.I watch a lot of B movies, so I wasn't expecting a great movie here, but this was definitely a letdown. This one is for completionists, or people who like and/or want to support B movies. Just go in with super low expectations.",3
40,Mindless actioner,"I haven't seen the first film, VENGEANCE, but on the strength of RETALIATION I'm in no hurry to. This is an action film that plays out in an extremely mindless way, with no thought at all having gone into the storyline. It just assembles a number of one-dimensional characters at a warehouse and industrial estate, splits them into two or three factions, and has them fight each other endlessly until the end credits roll. The best thing about it is the fight choreography, with well-executed kicks and satisfying hits throughout, but with no story or decent dialogue alongside it quickly becomes extremely mindless. The hero is a brawny ex-wrestler and Vinnie Jones is the baddie, and the whole thing treads water.",3
41,A proper throwback,"A solid movie that reminded me of the throwback 80s action movies. Ridiculous in concept, completely bonkers with its action and some trademark one liners that raised a smile from me.The film has been locked for being essentially one action scene. Although it's a movie I've seen plenty of times with Arnie, Sly and co, it is still a fun experience to sit back and watch.Vinnie Jones and Stu Bennett have chemistry together that carries this movie. The supporting cast do their bit to keep this going but this is where I knock stars off. The cast is not deep with memorable characters, like the aforementioned 80s movies it is inspired by. And the plot, yeah it is not original.I will recommend to give this a watch, for the two leads, the violence and the sheer fun I had. It's a British action flick which isn't trying to hide what it is, for that it should be commended.",7
42,Lame,"This is one of the lamest un believable movies yet.
I've never seen armed combat but I'm pretty sure shooting at people with a machine gun from 10 feet away is going to hit atleast one of them. Hand gun shooting at 20 30 40 feet and no one got hit??
Just not believable. I've seem prime time tv shows with more carnage and believable action than this.",1
43,It is worst than the first,"This has to be one of the worst action films of all time. Bad script, horrible acting and nonsensical and lousy fight choreography - this movie has it all. It is so bad as to be laughable.",2
44,Nice fighting scene but no plot story,Fighting scene mostly very nice.. but the story the plot seems too simple n too drag the same plot.. the movie scene just around the warehouse .. how the villain cant even just shot the hero because they already meet them almost 10 times in the movie,5
45,Most realistic action scenes ever,"The plot is simple. It's one man army Gold against legions of Imperial Stormtrooper washouts. Gold bursts into a room facing down a dozen guns a few meters away. They all miss the shot. And miss and miss and miss. They'd probably be sending out for ammo and still missing today if they weren't all killed. The sniper trying to kill Teague shoots a high power rifle a dozen meters away. Misses. Takes aim. Misses. Takes aim. Misses. Despite multiple targets still in sight, she pauses long enough for them to deliver backstory. Then switches to an RPG from point blank range. Misses. Another team has multiple laser spots on Gold. All miss. And we're only twenty minutes in...Ten stars.",10
46,Unplug and enjoy...,"Going into this film I just wanted to be entertained and that's exactly what I was. Vinnie Jones is always enjoyable and it's great to see Stu Bennett getting in the mix. This is simple fun, treat it as such and have a great time.",8
47,Seriously?,"Without ruining the story but I have no idea what I watched. Another poor Vinnie Jones outing (must have been one of those I did it for the money jobs). Vinnie Jones's character Teague (a traitor to his team and country) is quite unbelievable and unintimidating considering the big up speech they have him at the start.The dialogue is laughable and a poor effort, lots of one liners but no substance. The fight scenes unimaginative and uninspiring. Supposedly supposed to be a great black ops team but you wouldn't think so from the quality of their attacks and getting beaten so easily (looks like the best rep is not deserved). Also you can see people taking a hit when a kick out punch is still a distance away - at least with wrestling you expect a fake pantomime coreographed fight but this is seriously poor action film making at its worst. All smart dialogue and no substance.Overall very predictable story and poor acting from pretty much Z listers.If they spent more time writing a decent script and less time coming up with stupid quips and time wasting dialogue this could have been much better. Two out of ten is generous - it would have been 1/10 if I haven't seen worse before. Also why all the pausing when attacking someone - coming up with a corny one liner seems more important.I wouldn't waste your time watching this when there are plenty of decent action movies out there. I'll update my review if it imprints but so far - half way in I am unimpressed and close to switching off.",2
48,Lighten up people !,John Gold (character) reminds me of Ross Kemp in that episode of Extras! Lol.It's worth a watch. It's funny. Not sure if it's suppose to be 😃Was gonna give it 5 but added a point for comedy value.,6
49,A team can be a liability,John Gold (Stu Bennett) good guy must bring in Sean Teague (Vinnie Jones) bad guy. John and team go after Vinnie and team. Dun fight. Fist fight. Gun fight. First fight. Car wreak. Gun fight fight. Fist fight. Knife fight. Explosion. etc. etc. They needed to develop the story line better. Maybe a mole in the group. The fight choreographer must have been the script writer.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.,3
50,Cheese that can only be watched whilst drunk,Wow. My husband put this on without really finding out about it. We've just watched the first 20 minutes and it's the most diabolical diatribe we have ever seen. And he likes action and solder stuff too. Cheesiness extraordinaire! Watch if you have watched EVERY THING else first.,1
51,one scene on repeat,"The whole movie has been just a single action scene on the repeat. The only thing changing is the background. I don't think I have seen that many ""macho"" scenes in one movie since the 80s, dropping the gun to fight one on one, again and again.",3
52,This is what happens during a pandemic!,"Its like Vinny got a bunch of his geezers while bored during lockdown and decided to make a film. Its so bad, my cringe glands are hemorrhaging 🤣",1
53,Can't believe money was spent on this,"25 minutes in I had to turn it off. I've seen better acting at a kids panto. Unbelievably wooden, at one point two characters had red laser dots on them yet managed to avoid getting shot when opened fire upon. Fight scenes amazingly telegraphed.",1
54,Like Watching The A-Team Whup Ass,"British writer & director Ross Boyask observes all the conventions and clichés of bullet-riddled 1980's B-movies in his ""I Am Vengeance"" (2018) sequel aptly entitled ""I Am Vengeance: Retaliation"" (**1/2 OUT OF ****), with Stu Bennett reprising his role as the indestructible John Gold. Bennett wrestled professionally for WWE from 2007-2016. At six feet six, towering above most of the cast, the bearded Bennett resembles a stereotypical lumberjack without an axe. Meantime, he wears outfits like Arnold Schwarzenegger wore in the ""Terminator"" movies. Bennett appears as agile with his wits and fists in any slugfest as he is juggling knives, pistols, and assault rifles. Indeed, as gigantic as Bennett's John Gold is, you'd think the villains would have no trouble with killing him. All they have to do is aim high to take out this big galoot. ""I Am Vengeance: Retaliation"" is a better than average, but formulaic melodrama where the bad guys outnumber the good guys, but they have a tough time killing enough of the good guys. Presumably, inferior marksmanship accounts for these guys missing a man who presents such an accommodating target. The henchmen fare no better off tangling with John Gold (Stu Bennett of ""Dead Man Down"") in hand to hand combat. Mind you, Gold takes a smack every now and then to make things appear competitive, but this palooka winds up trampling them like a rampaging dinosaur. ""I Am Vengeance"" introduced the John Gold character, and Boyask must have been inspired by Michael Hodges's original ""Get Carter"" (1971) with Michael Caine as a revenge-driven mobster in search of his brother's killers. Similarly, John Gold blows into town to avenge the death of an old army chum at the hands of some bloodthirsty veterans peddling narcotics to the locals. Nevertheless, you need not have seen ""Vengeance"" to appreciate ""Retaliation.""""I Am Vengeance: Retaliation"" boasts a bigger budget, and Vinnie Jones of ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" makes a more menacing villain. Comparatively, the R-rated ""Vengeance"" clocked in at 92 minutes, while Boyask stages even more contentious firefights and close-quarters combat clashes in this profane, 82-minute, R-rated sequel. Happily, the ""Retaliation"" fights are orchestrated with greater polish and aplomb. For the record, ""Vengeance"" was strictly a one-man army revenge epic with our hero smashing a narcotics racket. Actually, John Gold was wounded at one point, and his enemies often reminded him about that soft spot. In ""Retaliation,"" our brawny hero heads up a team rather than handles the job solo.
The only holdover from ""Vengeance"" is Mark Griffin. He reprises his role as Gold's boss Frost. He relies on satellite technology to track Gold down to a London night club where our hero takes no prisoners during a brief fracas. Initially, Gold wants nothing to do with Frost, until Frost shows him a photo of his old nemesis Sean Teague. Gold thought Teague was dead. Gold remembers Teague when they worked together in the Department. Teague turned traitor, left Gold in the lurch, and defected to the opposition. Gold is shocked Teague is still very much alive and smuggling arms. He accepts the mission to abduct Teague and pack him off to a black site prison. Nonetheless, Gold abhors the prospect of bringing his old adversary in alive. ""His intel and contacts alone,"" argues Frost, ""are enough to bring down the baddest of the bad."" Meanwhile, Frost promises to wipe Gold's slate clean, so he can stop dodging the Department.Frost's two agents, Shapiro (Sam Benjamin of ""Justice League"") and Lynch (Phoebe Robinson-Galvin of ""Black Site""), accompany Gold, and the three surprise Teague at his makeshift hideout in England. A model of efficiency, this firefight qualifies as the best because the good guys hit what they shoot. Gold takes Teague into custody. No sooner does it look like smooth sailing ahead for our heroes than Boyask complicates matters. He throws in a mysterious, loose cannon, James Bond type, female interloper. Jen Quaid (Katrina Durden of ""Kick Ass 2"") wants Teague dead because he murdered her father. Our heroes are loading Teague aboard a van when she draws a bead on them. Everybody ducks for cover when she starts shooting at them with a telescopic sniper rifle. Our heroes elude her until engine problems force them to make a pit stop at an abandoned factory. She follows them. Again, Quaid tries to kill Teague. This time she brandishes a LAWS rocket, a disposable, hand-held, single-shot weapon which fires a 66mm unguided anti-tank round. Predictably, Quaid pulverizes the van, but Gold, Teague, Lynch and Shapiro escape injury!If Quaid didn't pose enough of a problem, Teague's well-armed henchmen and his bosomy blonde fiancée Pearl (Jessica-Jane Stafford of ""Dragon Kingdom"") appear and pandemonium erupts. At one point, Gold challenges Teague's henchmen with nothing more than a baton. Predictably, Gold kicks the crap out of them. One of them isn't so compliant, and he puts his gun to Gold's head. The leader, Renner (Bentley Kalu of ""American Assassin""), orders him to pull the trigger. When the henchman's automatic pistol jams, he shouts ""stoppage."" Naturally, fortune favors our hero at this critical moment.
Sometimes, both the good guys and bad guys blaze away, but miraculously miss each other. Afterward, they opt to make it more personal. Shedding their firearms, they flaunt their martial arts skills. Since more henchmen are on hand, ""Retaliation"" has bigger and bolder ambitions. For instance, during the introductory nightclub scene, Gold whips five guys. He shoots the first one for simply threatening him at gunpoint, then disposes of the rest without a qualm. The bad guys could easily have killed our heroes on some occasions, but they allow hubris to go to their heads. Watching ""Retaliation"" is like watching several ""The A-Team"" television episodes. Simon Rowling's impeccable widescreen cinematography makes ""Retaliation"" look far bigger than its low budget for a home video release. Robust but overwrought, ""I Am Vengeance: Retaliation"" lacks the tingling, razor-edged spontaneity of Boyask's earlier British gangster saga ""10 Dead Men.""",7
55,Unrealistic OPS,"Highly trained special ops & ruthless killers that can't shoot, it's so embarrassing. The continued forced entry of 'birds' as tough fighters that act like blokes (so unrealistic), one who is just related to an ex-military bloke but somehow became a sniper with EOD & MMA/WWE fighting skills & is more talented than any of the current special ops members.1. As mentioned by others, you have a rocket launcher that should have blown up a vehicle, nope, just takes out a door.2. 8 guys shooting at the main man coming through the door, not 1 bullet hit the guy.3. 5 guys shooting at 2 people who have to leap over concrete barriers to escape, not 1 bullet hit them.4. One of Vinnie Jones worst movies I've seen, he's usually pretty good but this was horrible.",1
56,Deep voice Blank bullets,"A Modern day ""A Team"" ... 99% blank bullets ... lots of WWE style fighting ... the main character has the required deep voice and strong name ... A both ridiculous yet amusing hours worth ... ok for a dull evening.",1
57,Seriously bad,"There is no proper flow throughout the film. The action is almost laughable if this wasn't supposed to be an action film I would think it was a spoof. Gun fights from 5 feet apart, acting seems labored. If I didn't know any better I would think the script was plagiarized from kids on the playground. There were moments when I honestly felt like a 10 year old telling his friends about a movie he saw would do a better job of delivering an action story.",2
58,This movie is action packed and it delivers,Those who are giving poor reviews had either not seen the trailer or was expecting oscar level things in vod movie. This movie though on limited budget tried and quite successfully hidden the cheapness in settings with colourful camera work and delight to eyes. The acting is all right and the on liners are great. Vinnie is a veteran so he is all right. Katrina is the surprise package and with stu Bennett the action was awesome. The action choreography was nice. This movie will rank in better half of vod movies. Just go for it from a action fan,10
59,"7000 rounds among mercenary, ex military and a SNIPER!!!",And no one can land a hit? This movie lent a lot for comedic purposes but it's hard to take it seriously when they say and do things that go against even the most basic of common sense...,2
60,Weak stuff,"This wasn't a very good movie.Pretty much like ""Gaturro"", this was a boring CGI film without very much entertainment value.The animation was poor and the aesthetic of the characters designs looked derivative of the films done by Pixar and Dreamworks.Sadly, the plot isn't much better either, being boring, dull and generic for most of the time. The characters were bland stereotypes without any interesting quality about them. The jokes weren't funny.In my opinion, ""Boogie the Oily One"" and ""Fierro"" were much better examples of Argentinean animated films, while this one was just something totally forgettable.",2
61,bad animation,Jack (Drake Bell) is a plain sparrow and the girls ignore him in favor for the flashier birds. Aurora (Ashley Tisdale) is a prized captive yellow canary of a ruthless corporate tycoon. She manages to escape and is befriended by Jack and others.The colors are gawdy rather than being beautiful. The animation is good for the 90s at best. The design is blocky. There is some blurring which I hope is the result of converting between 3D and 2D. The story is the only functional aspect. It's about being yourself and that's always good family fare. This is really old school and not in a good way.,3
62,Not exactly paradise,"As has been said by me many times, am a huge fan of animation. Always have been, always will be, so naturally will see any animated film regardless of age, how high budget or not it is and the studio/director it comes from.There are far better animated films than 'Birds of Paradise', naming them however would be unfair but many are likely to put forward the best of Disney and Pixar. There are also infinitely worse, at least with 'Birds of Paradise' some effort was put into it which is more than can be said with far more amateurish efforts like Video Brinquedo and Spark Plug Entertainment. 'Birds of Paradise' may not be one's definition of paradise, but it is a long way from hell.'Birds of Paradise' has good elements. The voice cast are mostly quite accomplished. Ken Jeong and Jon Lovitz give fun comic relief and there are distinguished contributions from Jane Lynch and Keith David. Ashley Tisdale does much more than just constantly screaming at the top of her lungs and shouting her lines, while not always subtle her voice work is more dynamic than that.It also starts off well with a vibrant and energetic opening that shows a lot of promise, and there is a good deal of energy in the first half or so. The music has colour and infectious groove that fits well and the positive messaging the film has was delivered well and will be appreciated by kids and adults alike regardless of their familiarity. Some of the comic relief is fun.However, the animation itself isn't too great. Some nice colours here and there but there is a lack of refinement and attention to detail can be static. Worst of all are the blocky and unnatural character designs, the characters were described elsewhere as looking like chicken wings doused in brightly coloured dye reminiscent of the Easter period, as funny as this sounds that sums up the character designs aptly.While most of the voice cast are fine, Drake Bell overdoes it and is neither sympathetic or fun. He does fail to convey a shred of sympathy or charm for a character written so shallowly that rooting for him, his quest or his lukewarm at best chemistry with Aurora was difficult. The story is very standard fare and gets flimsier and flimsier after a promising opening, it also takes a gloomier tone in the second half and tonally it's too jarringly uneven. The script is neither awful or brilliant, just middle of the road bland.Overall, has enough to make it watchable but less than heavenly. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5
63,A BIRD OF MY TALENT,"It is hard not to like a kid's film with all the neat graphics, characters, and songs...like ""Rio"". This wasn't ""Rio."" Jack Sparrow wants to be an exotic bird to attract Valley Doves who are ""out of his league"" and a different species too. He meets an exotic yellow bird who just wants to blend in. Jack gets paint spilled on him and now looks exotic. His hummingbird friend has a sugar buzz going. There is also a pigeon and a bat, who is not a vampire, helping him out. And then there is the race thing and birds who feed on other bird thing, and it was boring as hell as I fell asleep during the middle of it until the boos from the movie theater woke me up.I did like the valley dove shallow talk and the humming bird with a nectar buzz.",3
64,Do yourself a favor and watch the series instead.,"Just finished watching the box set of the original TV series, followed by this movie. This movie uses clips from the original show, and new scenes to present almost the same story in a somewhat different manner. I did some brief math and compared to the show, this movie moves at an Olympic Sprinter's pace. The first 60 of this 98 minute movie is used to give a very spark-notes like version of the first half of the show. There were characters, scenes and situations entirely cut. This leads to almost a hyper-active feeling because speaking moments are rapidly cut with action scenes cut with a moment that should be character building but they are already cutting to the next action scene. The next 38 minutes of this movie are where this movie differs from the series. The last half of the series is almost completely rewritten basically erasing many characters/plot points/events that would appear, and reversing the motivations of one of the most important characters. The events of the original last two episodes are used to set up a finale that, after this wild ride, feels only sub-par at best. In conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this movie. It's much too quickly paced, there is little characterization, events seem to happen that you might only understand if you watch the series, and many scenes (except the ones where they fight their way out with robots) have underwhelming conclusions. I wouldn't recommend getting this unless you are a completionist, otherwise, skip it.",3
65,A not so great retell of the story,"Admittingly I don't mind seeing brand new content of an anime i enjoy watching (yes i know this movie is a decade and a half old) even if it's a retall or a recap of a series which is compressed into a movie.But if you are going to do a retell at least try to make sense of it. Which is what this movie suffers from. It honestly feels like bits of the series were edited together to make this movie and some of the important characters (Alicia, Tony, Rick, Emerick etc.) where either non existent or rewritten which made zero sense at all at what I am watching.Do yourself a favour and stick to the series.",4
66,Watch the series instead.,"This movie sadly falls short as some of the most impactful moments for the characters are cut out as well as the entirety of of stories final act.The series has one of the best and deepest stories from any anime of the time, and is an absolute must watch not only for sci-fi fans but for those who love deep existential dives into humanity.The movie sadly focuses more on the action side of the show.",2
67,"Well, I liked it.","If you're like me and can enjoy a drama that injects horror motifs, I think you might like this movie. Otherwise, it's probably going to be too talkative, with disappointing amounts of gore. To some extent, I might compare it to Dawn of the Dead (1978), my personal favorite of Romero's zombie saga (and one of my favorite movies ever). It's not nearly as good, but it has a lot of similarities: left-leaning political message, sparing use of zombies, more emphasis on human drama than gore, and a very raw, low budget look. Compare this to the Dawn remake, which streamlined away just about everything but the zombies and gore. If you're more a fan of the original than the remake, maybe you'll find something to like here. The big problem is that, despite how heavy-handed Romero's political and social commentary are, this movie is even more preachy and less subtle, with characters outright lecturing each other. Also, the gore is very low budget, looking a bit unimpressive. I've seen Troma movies that looked like they had a bigger budget than this movie. Still, if you can get past the faults, and you can withstand some preachy commentary, I think you might like this movie.The plot revolves around a Voodoo priestess raising a zombie horde from poor (and probably illegal) immigrants -- people that nobody will ever miss. When a battered wife, who had consulted the Voodoo priestess, seeks help from a feminist reporter and a Marxist con man with a heart of gold, the zombies and the priestess seek to kill them all, to keep the operation quiet. If this sounds a bit confused, cluttered, preachy, and silly, then yeah, you'd be right... but it's still fun.Admittedly, I'm being quite generous in giving it a 7/10, but the liberal political message resonated with me, and I liked the characters. The zombies were also somewhat creative, being an even mix of Haitian zombies and Romero ghouls, which might annoy some horror fans, who expect a movie to pick one style and stick with it. If you're looking for something higher budget, with good SFX and lots of gore, I'd suggest the Dawn of the Dead remake, instead of this. If you like this, you might also like Deadgirl, another rather talky, low budget drama that uses zombies and other horror motifs in order to deliver social criticism.",7
68,Zombie horror? Should be labeled cultural pseudo-occult heritage documentary...,"Alright, well ""Zombie Farm"" was nothing at all what I had expected or hoped it would be. Having bought it from Amazon, I was intrigued by the rather interesting looking DVD cover, and being a fan of all things zombie, I just had to add it to my collection.""Zombie Farm"" almost literally takes forever to get up in pace and take you places. The first half of the movie is about film-maker Pilar Franco (played by Adriana Cataño, who actually did a rather good job) following the small time swindler and seer Roque (played by Roberto Montesinos) around in order to make a documentary. He is taking money from the naive and hopeful, in return giving them something to hold on to in their troubled lives and situations. However, one client visits a voodoo woman after Roque failed to help her with her violent husband, and end up being haunted by her husband whom has now returned from death.""Zombie Farm"" gives you a lot of facts, whether they are true or just made up I know not, about certain aspects of the Latino knack for the supernatural. And yeah, I did find that interesting, but sitting for about half a movie 'learning' about this cultural stuff was not what I had expected from a movie labeled 'horror'.Then finally the zombies were revealed, yeah, it turned out there actually was zombies in the movie, but don't get your hopes up. Nothing major to come for here. It is not zombies in the Hollywood (or Romero-influenced) manner as most of us love, but take on that whole voodoo aspect, which didn't really impress me.Truth be told, then I fell asleep during this movie, it was just so dull and uneventful, not to mention slow paced. It was like its engine was left on, but the gear was in neutral. This movie fairly much was dull inside out. I don't know if you have to be Latino to fully grasp what was going on in this movie, or if you have to be into voodoo, but I do know, that for a zombie aficionado (Romero-style, and proud of it) like myself, then ""Zombie Farm"" was all but impressive. The movie was fighting a struggling battle uphill, and lost, I might add.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't all bad. The movie was actually nicely shot, and they did good jobs with the camera work. And the people cast for the various roles were actually doing great jobs, and it was nice to see an entire cast of new faces for a change.Just goes to prove the old saying: ""don't judge a book by its cover"". Which in this case was a DVD cover. I bought it solely because the cover was appealing and held the promise of some proper zombie action. ""Zombie Farm"" will be shelved in my DVD collection, bagged and tagged, never to be taken out and put into the DVD player ever again, it was just not worth the time of day.",3

The film opens panning over the waters of Louisiana with some light guitar playing in a Spanish style. The film is definitely of a Hispanic or Latino flavor, with the cast and crew being of that background. And I hate to lump Latino films into one group, but they have not fared well -- even the ones that featured known actors, like ""Day of the Dead"", were pretty awful. I have not seen a good film from the Hispanic community since the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky.Perhaps you're wondering why the film took two years to be released? Or why it is named the same as a 2007 film, which was also overlooked by most people. I do not have those answers... you would have to ask the writer and director, Ricardo Islas.I am not going to lie. I opened my mail, found this film, and immediately groaned. One, zombies are overdone. I do not need more zombie films. Two, I have not heard of a single cast or crew member associated with this film, so I had no base to work from. And three, it came from Maya Entertainment, which I have no idea what that is. So my expectations were about as low as they could possible be. And, luckily, it was better than those expectations.The film tries to make social commentary by mentioning pedophile priests and Homeland Security tearing families apart (their words, not mine). There is talk of Marines invading Panama and raping the women, and how those babies (brown with blue eyes) are an improvement of the race. What the heck? These commentaries are just so haphazard, thrown in without cause. Maybe to stir people up, but for no reason I can tell.As for the zombies, well, they come from a voodoo priestess (who is Hispanic, not Caribbean, but does live in Louisiana). And they do not show up until a good while into the film. This is a family drama about domestic abuse... the zombie aspect of the story is just sort of thrown in, and I am not sure why. If there is supposed to be a subtle satire, they lost it on me.It sounds like I am bashing the film, and I am. Yet, you will see I gave it a decent rating. Here is why: although it is not really a horror film, but a drama about race and abuse with some horror elements, it is decent, and probably a good film if you go in with the right mindset. I think horror fans will be mislead and disappointed, but the Latino community may identify with it... I, unfortunately, am not part of that community and can only speculate.",6
70,"Great male lead, horrible everything else!","The Zombie Farm - okay, this might be the worst movie I've ever watched, but it does have some high points.It's (obviously) a zombie flick, but they become zombies the old fashioned way, through voodoo. Later, they become like the zombies we deal with today, eating human flesh, lumbering about and what not. The acting of almost every character is on a level with that in corporate training films - stilted, a bit amateurish, and it's hard to bond with the characters. The cast was all-Hispanic, except for a random Asian zombie. Lighting and cinematography are very poor, the pace is similar to that in the classic ""Carnival of Souls,"" IE, slow as molasses.In spite of that, the movie had a ""Ghostbreakers"" air about it (the classic Bob Hope zombie and Cuban island mystery) though it is in no respect equivalent - I'm thinking more of the relationship between the male and female leads as being similar to that between Hope and Paulette Goddard. The female lead, while semi cute, is nothing special, but the male lead was actually interesting, played by Roberto Montesinos. His experience shows, as he's the only character who actually shines in this thing. He looked familiar, and looking up his CV I can see he's been around.I can't say much that's positive about this movie, but as I say, Mr. Montesinos as a sham fortune teller con man (with a heart of gold) IS memorable, and makes the experience not a complete waste of time. With him, it's a 5 - without him, it's a 3-4.",5
71,MY DEAD HUSBAND DOESN'T LEAVE ME ALONE,"The film touches on multiple themes as a domestic violence victim (Monika Munoz) seeks the help of a Latino charlatan Roque (Roberto Montesinos) who is not all bad. Roque is the topic of film being shot by Pilar Franco (Adriana Cataño). Unable to help the woman, she seeks the aid of the mysterious Macumba (Mariana Da Silva) who gives her a potion for her husband to drink.By the time the Zombie Farm aspect enters the film, it has about twenty minutes left. The bulk of the film is about building the character of Roque who makes general statements about Latino's envy of white society which is a far larger part of the film than the zombie aspect.The film is not badly done, and pretty decent for a low budget independent. But on a pure zombie scale, it is strictly second tier.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex, or nudity.",6
72,zombies on a farm what?,"I never learn, do not buy a DVD which is number 68 in the charts and expect it to be any good.This film with what seems to be Spanish actors was dreadful, it starts with a woman getting beat up by her drunk husband and then she goes to see this man who advertises himself on the TV as some sort of helper for anything you want. The woman goes to see him and asks if he can help her with her wife beating husband but he says I cannot, she then goes to another source a woman she reads about in the paper.She then returns to the man and tells him shes killed her husband after giving him a potion from this woman, unfortunately he keeps coming back at night to see her to which all of a sudden a noise and the husband is there a zombie no less! He attacks them but they get away and go to the mans friend's house.There is also another female who wants to film this man so she tags along, that night the zombie finds them and attacks again and again they get away.The first hour of this film is mainly what I outlined you only see this one zombie and its boring!!! The last half hour they go to this woman's place (the one who gave the potion) and find she has zombies in her backyard so like most films go in her house and get caught and tied up and wait for the zombies to come out.The ending is all the zombies die because the woman made them with this potion and voodoo and when their effigies fall into a fire the zombies die smoking!! I found the acting wooden the story too tedious so my advice is please check that any film you want to buy you look it up beforehand on sites like IMDb, I wasted money and time on this piece of crap.",1
73,Enjoyable low-budget blend of drama and horror,"Scared young Ana Maria (a sound and sympathetic performance by Monika Munoz) hires evil and powerful voodoo priestess Mana Luna (robustly played with wicked gusto by Nadia Rowinsky) to whip up a special potion to transform her abusive husband Antonio (a perfectly hateful Khotan) into a better man. Unfortunately, said potion transforms Antonio into a zombie instead. Ana Maria enlists the assistance of spunky aspiring reporter Pilar Franco (a nicely spirited turn by Adriana Catano) and amiable charlatan spiritual guide Roque (a marvelously jolly and charismatic performance by Roberto Montesinos) to resolve the situation. Writer/director Ricardo Islas relates the entertaining story at a brisk pace, stages the zombie attack scenes with flair, delivers plenty of amusing moments of good-natured humor (the constant banter between Pilar and Roque is quite snappy and often hilarious), and generates a good deal of tension and spooky atmosphere in the nightmarish last third. Moreover, it's acted with zest by a capable and engaging cast; the warm, funny, and lively chemistry between Catano and Montesinos in particular keeps the picture humming throughout. Mariana De Silva supplies a little extra spice as Roque's brash secretary. The Latino cultural aspect gives the movie its own neat distinctive flavor while the pertinent social commentary on such hot button issues as domestic violence and exploiting illegal immigrants as cheap slave labor provides an additional substantial dramatic punch. Both Christian Herrera's sharp cinematography and Aritz Villodas' melodic score are up to par. A fun and offbeat fright flick.",8
74,Turned Out Okay,"""Pilar Franco"" (Adriana Catano) is a film maker who desperately wants an opportunity to showcase her abilities. So one day she sees a mystic on television named ""Roque"" (Roberto Montesinos) purporting to be able to cure people through spiritual means and she decides to film a documentary on him. Even though he is clearly a phony he figures he could use a little publicity so he agrees. Yet as it so happens the first patient that comes in named ""Ana Marie"" (Monika Munoz) has a serious problem which eventually leads both Pilar and Roque to a Brazilian high priestess who is very skillful in the black art of voodoo-and unlike Roque she is the real McCoy. Now rather than reveal any more of this film and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I honestly didn't expect too much from this movie. But after the first 10 minutes or so I realized that it was much better than I expected it to be as it combined touches of humor with a rather decent zombie plot. Additionally, the fact that both Monika Munoz and Adriana Catano were rather attractive certainly didn't hurt either. In any case, I liked this movie and therefore rate it as slightly above average.",6
75,A cartoon movie well-made!,"This movie is actually great! I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was! I didn't grow up watching the Jetsons at all. So I couldn't compare it to the actual cartoon but part of me wishes I did. The music was pretty catchy and it's heart felt moments made me wish I was a kid watching this! I love that cute little guy Elroy! He was my favorite!Reminder, this was made in the 90's. Obviously flaws but that doesn't matter. This movie with it's flaws made it great! The message of the movie is that family comes first! That's what matters!",8
76,A Good Movie Based On The Classic Cartoon Series,"I've been watching Jetsons The Movie for many years. It is one of my favorite movies. Out of all the movies that were based on Hanna-Barbera cartoons, I have to say that is one of the better ones. While it's not without it's problems/flaws, it's better than some of the animated films that are coming out today. I love The Jetsons. I love both the original Jetsons cartoon series and the movie. If it wasn't for the film, I wouldn't be The Jetsons fan that I am today. It's a very underrate film.
 
 The animation was good and very colorful. I loved that they mixed CGI with 2D Animation. The CGI may have not been the greatest but it was decent. I even loved the new characters like Judy's boyfriend, Apollo Blue, the Grungrees and the Robot Family. Plus this film has a great soundtrack. My favorite songs are You And Me, Staying Together and Home. The voice acting was good too and I even have to admit that Tiffany did a good job voicing Judy. She isn't much of an actress but she does ok. The story was good and decent but wasn't without it's flaws. Judy's subplot is one of the flaws in the story. I can understand her being upset about not going out on a date with Cosmic Cosmo but come on...she hardly knew him and he hardly knew her. It's stupid! I felt that Elroy's subplot with Teddy-2 (the robot boy) was done better. I don't hate Judy's subplot but I wish it was done a little better.One of the things that the film did right was give The Jetsons friends. One of the things that The Jetsons television series lacked was friends for The Jetsons. Plus I wish that the film was longer so that The Jetsons could interact with their new friends/neighbors a bit longer and expand upon their new friendships (like Judy spending more time with Apollo and getting to know him better). I still love this film even though it has it's problems and flaws. It's not the greatest animated film ever made but it's not horrible. There are worse movies out there and some movies deserve to be forgotten, but Jetsons The Movie (at least in my opinion) doesn't deserve to be forgotten. There are people who do love this film and I'm one of them. The film is still watchable, fun and enjoyable. The film has a good message about protecting the environment and actually does a better job with it's environmental message than some of the other environmental films that came after it. The film does stay true to the original television series and like the television series, the film does have it's warm and loving moments. It's a good film for the entire family and if you are an animation fan, I would give this a watch. Plus I do know the story behind this film and how Judy's original voice actress Janet Waldo was replaced by Tiffany. While I said that I thought that Tiffany did a good job voicing Judy, I have to be fair to Janet Waldo since she voiced Judy for a long time and really loved doing The Jetsons. She was very hurt and heartbroken over the decision that Universal Studios made to replace her with Tiffany and I felt really sorry for her and half of me is mad at Universal for making that decision but I don't hate Tiffany or her performance as Judy Jetson. I still believe that Tiffany did do a good job. To be honest, I love both Janet Waldo and Tiffany as Judy Jetson. But one thing is for sure, Janet Waldo will always be Judy Jetson.",7
77,Excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances,"JETSONS: THE MOVIE, in my opinion, is an excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances. Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, it's hard to say who I liked the best. In addition, I thought that Mr. Spacely (voice of Mel Blanc) was a very cantankerous guy. However, I thought that Teddy 2 (voice of Dana Hill) was an absolute a******. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did a very good job. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent film adaptation of a classic TV show with appealing performances to any fan who hasn't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",9
78,"The first-ever Jetsons big-screen, musical, eye-candy romp!","Since it's the Jetsons' first big screen film, Hanna-Barbera had to work hard to bring something fresh and original to their space-age series, right? Nope. So the day begins with George heading off to his job, and getting caught in traffic. Same old, same old. Unfortunately his new traffic-beater: Inflat-a-Cop didn't help much, a REAL cop showed up and made him give it a fatal deflate. So after arriving at Spacely Sprockets and Spindles, George sits at his desk and takes a nap, while Mr. Spacely meets with some legitimate stock brokers, looking for them to invest in his orbiting ore asteroid. But when he receives word, right in front of the brokers, that the man sent to operate it has run away, they quickly withdraw. Yes, Throttlebottom was the 4th vice president to run off the job at the asteroid, so Spacely needed a new man. Guess who he picks? Right, when he had no other viable choice, he goes with his man Friday, and every other day of the week, George Jetson. Unfortunately briefing him on his new job sends him into overtime so he misses Elroy's basketball game, and he scores the winning shot! George comes home to tell the family that they have to drop all immediate plans because they're moving out to the asteroid. This means Elroy will have to quit the team and Judy will have to give up her random date with Cosmic Cosmo. Her life is over, says Jane. But the important thing is... George is a vice president. Yep, it's all about what George wants. This seems reason enough for the family to agree with his reasoning. Judy was too heartbroken to agree, but apparently nobody seemed to care. They all fly off into space, eventually getting to where the ore asteroid is located as well as their new home: Intergalactic Garden Estates. Well they arrive at their new apartment and find it empty, highly unusual, but thanks to Rosie's remote control, the place instantly fills with their stuff. They meet their happening new neighbors, the big blue fur covered Furbelows...and sadly, we won't be seeing them again for the rest of the movie; VP George Jetson heads off to the plant the next morning, finally getting to be his own boss. Let's just hope he doesn't fire himself. The plant's supervisor, robot Rudy 2, gives George the breakdown on operations, in a catchy song.Elroy joins a new basketball team and instantly meets his match in Teddy 2 who is a well known cheater. I think they're going to be best enemies; Lucy 2 , Jane and Judy check out the ginormous shopping mall, but Judy goes off by herself to pout...until she literally runs into a handsome young alien-man, Apollo Blue, and it isn't long before they make beautiful music together. Seriously, they collaborate on a really awesome rock song and a music video you'd never expect in a Hanna-Barbera cartoon; Opening day of the plant begins. George presses the button and all hell breaks loose. The machinery blows gaskets, shooting sprockets everywhere. Teddy 2 is trapped in the barrage and Elroy saves him, so now I guess they're friends; Rudy 2 concludes this as sabotage. Who could have done it? Well sir, Mr. Spacely is none too pleased about this and heads out to the asteroid on a really cheap flight; George decides to work late one night to catch the saboteurs, when he gets captured. Elroy and Teddy 2 decide to do some detective work of their own, so they sneak into the plant and soon discover the root of the mêlée: little cute, furry creatures called Grungies. Meanwhile, Jane notices her son is gone and has no problem interrupting Judy's date to ask if Elroy were with them...Stupid question. She makes Judy go look for him. What a nice mom. Astro spills where they are, so now they're off to the plant, where it is soon discovered why the Grungies made it their duty to sabotage the place: it's right above their homes. The big drilling bore destroys a part of it every day. That's terribly tragic! George is discovered bound and gagged, so before untying him, Jane decides it's finally time for him to fess up on how much he REALLY thinks about his family. ""You're all I think about."" Not lately, George. He hears about the Grungies' plight and decides something must be done. Meanwhile, Spacely arrives and demands the machines be started. Rudy 2 tries to stop him because of the Jetsons were down there, so Spacely commits robotslaughter and presses the button. We get a frantic situation as well as an unnecessary tense moment as we think Elroy may have been crushed by falling rocks. So they all go topside and George finally finds the guts to stand up to his evil little boss, and then each family member as well as Apollo preach to him about what he's doing to the environment...of the Grungies. So in the end, it all works out. Spacely reluctantly makes them partners, they recycle old sprockets, so no more digging, all is well, but now George isn't needed there so the family has to move back. Great, uprooted a second time. So they all bid farewell to their new friends and head back to Earth.My first question is the title. Why didn't they call it The Jetsons Movie? I guess Jetsons: The Movie sounded cooler. The animation is superb, the soundtrack is awesome, but the story is very weak. It's just recycled plot lines from the TV series, and the voice acting is horrible, mainly due to Tiffany taking over Judy. She was awful, and now Judy says things like ""outergalactical"". This was probably the final word on The Jetsons and they STILL didn't give Judy much development. Jetsons: The Movie could have been better. It's not GOOD, but it's not terrible. It's better than practically anything animated coming out today.",7
79,It doesn't get cornier than this,"Big screen continuation of the 1960s cartoon series is alternately old-fashioned to a corny degree and modern in the most grating ways. All of the humor is like that of the old series, for those who are fans. I am not so it was like nails on a chalkboard for me while watching this. At least there wasn't a laugh track. The ""modern"" stuff added includes some environmentalist proselytizing and some truly terrible late '80s/early '90s style pop music. Tiffany and synth beats, folks. Yuck! Speaking of Tiffany, she was brought in to play Judy Jetson and replace Janet Waldo, the original Judy. She does an awful job. Of the rest of the cast, the original voice for Elroy, Daws Butler, had died before this so he had to be replaced. Sadly, both George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc also died during production. Overall, this is a corny stinker that's saved only by some nice animation. It's very colorful and fluid and I'll give it credit for that. But this is really just something fans of the old show will want to check out for curiosity's sake. I can't imagine anyone else liking it.",4
80,Your Standard Cartoon Movie,"George Jetson is forced to uproot his family when Mr. Spacely promotes him to take charge of a new factory on a distant planet.I can't say this is a great movie, but I guess it's not terrible, either. It is a family film and one that smaller children will probably enjoy. The message is a bit heavy-handed and may not appeal to everyone, as it exaggerates the idea of conservation.The creators also seem like they really wanted to build the film around Tiffany / Judy, including a music video that was apparently illustrated by different artists. Could the song have been a hit in 1990 and helped this film? Maybe, but so far as I know that never happened.",5
81,I Loved It!!! :o),"Let me tell you, when I was a little girl, I HATED ""The Jetsons"" (even though they were re-runs put on tv like most old tv shows are now these days).  I thought that the show was boring and too lame, and for that, I had no interest in seeing this movie.  However, when I was at a slumber party one of my childhood friends was throwing for her birthday, they rented ""Jetsons:  The Movie"", and from what I heard from one of the girls was that the movie was good.  So, I thought, ""Well, we'll see!""Actually, it was better than I thought!  Former teenage sensation, Tiffany, updated Judy Jetson to the 1990's, and I loved most of the songs that were in this movie!  I found this movie really interesting and I loved it!  I still do!  It's a great idea to bring this movie into the 1990's since the show is from the 1960's (or somewhat around that time?) and obviously, the actual show is quite corny if you ask me.I really liked ""Jetsons: The Movie"".  I was very pleased with it!!!! :o)",10
82,Great Memories,"This was one of my favorite cartoons in my childhood, and i must say i first watched movie and then TV show, i see many negative comments about this movie, why so many hate, okay it is more commercial than TV show, but i really enjoyed this one as a child, and i am enjoying it now as an adult, it is very positive movie and great finish for whole Jetsons serial. Only negative minus is maybe the voice acting of singer Tiffany as Judy, her voice just don't fit with Judy, that was a big minus and yes also i didn't like her space boyfriend, he looks like some alien/elf version of Peter Pan. But other things are great, i really love music you can really feel the mix between 80's and 90's decade, and the whole style of the movie is like that. I also like environmental issues, and how because of our greed we are destroying whole worlds and other cultures and societies. I will definitely love this movie and TV show and this memorable characters to the end of my life, and i hope i will play this to my children, to became better people in this dark world.",8
83,"*****,a perfect 5 stars,the movie based on the infamous space age family does something most TV-show based films fail to do.","One of the biggest reasons why I gave this film a ***** star rating is because it does something no other TV-show based movie has done a perfect flawless unerring(perfect) translation of the classic TV animated series(I certainly have no problem with artistic license WHATSOEVER! but still its kinda nice on how they do a fully accurate translation for once) & besides the movie has a good story which wouldn't disappoint hard-core jetson fans(although I'll tell you know I'm not a jetson fan I liked the show & the movie did perfect justice to a good series) & it has beautiful CGI & great music(especially the jetsons rap) so all in all this is perfection for any Jetsons fan & even if you're not a jetsons fan (like myself) this film whould give ya fun time anyways,BYE!",10
84,What May Be Considered An Extended Jetsons Episode With A Social Awareness.,"I remember renting a copy of this and seeing it years back. It had also been years since I'd last seen it, but I recall finding it enjoyable. I'd thought about this movie for a while and I was in the mood to see it again. I finally did a few late nights/early mornings ago, after spending some time tracking down a copy of streaming video available for it that wasn't pay per view/on demand or recorded with a camcorder or I-Pod/I-Touch (as I found for a couple of copies on Youtube, each with a different, aforementioned problem with it as I just described). Also had to track it down to watch for free online, due to it airing on a cable channel at times that are inconvenient for me, therefore being unable to catch it.Now, more about the feature. The first thing that comes to mind and what I must mention is the crisper 2D animation as well as the CGI for some of the background scenes. I love how the art style of the former is such an upgrade from that of the 1960s episodes (the animation in the '80s episodes may have also been an improvement a little at least, if not as much as in this), so that's a nice plus. I know that the one notable beef that most would have with the movie is the fact that Judy Jetson's original voice actress, Janet Waldo, was replaced with the former teen pop singer Tiffany. When I first saw this, I noticed that Judy's voice sounded different here than from the t.v. series and I wondered why, what's up with that. Whoever was/were in charge of changing part of the cast didn't even get someone to do a more dead-on imitation of the original if they must replace the original. But recently I found out one reason was an attempt to cash in and ride on Tiffany's success, which I now know the short story behind that. I'm not 100% sure about this, but I think I'd have to hear audio of Janet and Tiffany's takes on Judy's voice played back-to-back, since now I think they're nearly the same. A reviewer on here claimed that this movie just consists of and contains various, previous plots from the series. I'd have to see several of them again to try noticing that for myself, as I only remember a limited number of episode plots, some more than others. What else I love about this movie is the side plots, like the Jetsons meeting their new neighbors, the 2s and the Furbelows, and the eventual alliance between Elroy Jetson and Teddy 2. I love the new characters introduced here and it'd be great if more could've been done with them somehow. Some of those who gripe about the preachy message thrown into the movie act like the whole movie revolves around the environment, particularly that of the Grungees' abode within the asteroid. Maybe I could see the problem if that were true, but it isn't really, as that comes about much later. Another first and only (other than the film itself) is that, yes, George Jetson does stand up to his boss, Mr. Spacely, for a change at last, when he finds the destruction the machines making the sprockets in the factory over the asteroid are doing to the Grungees' homes and that helping to protect them is what's more important in the end. I also learned that the subject of enviromentalism was taken on for this because it was one of the things that were heavily focused on and popular at the time (a couple of other animated media concerning this, Captain Plant and the Planeteers and Widget the World Watcher, come to mind). For first time watchers of this, I say y'all should check it out if nobody reading this has, because another thing it has going for it is the jokes. Like Fergie Furbelow being mistaken for a boy ironically. I'm among all those who find it captivating anyway, despite the few flaws it may have. And I agree with the reviewer who stated that it's still many light years ahead of the majority of cartoons hitting the airwaves these days, even if this could've used something more.",8
85,"""Thanks George!""","This movie was very well done. Tiffany did an awesome job with her songs, as well as her overall performance as Judy. Astro of course, was classic. ""Ri Ruv Ru Reorge!"" My favorite song was the finale, ""Home"" by Tiffany. It brings a tear to my eye every time I hear it. The other songs were awesome as well. The overall story was very strong, and very unpredictable. The plant sabotage premise was strong and made for awesome storytelling. Mr. Spacely was up to his usual shenanigans, trying to take advantage of naive George. His classic scream got better and better as the movie went on. It's always sad when a performer dies before the production is finished and they never get to see the end result. At the end, when the Grungees spell out ""Thanks George"" on the roof of the plant, what an awesome tribute to George O' Hanlon. He put his whole life into that character and it showed. Thanks, George, you will be missed!",10
86,A Great classic that everyone will love!,"This was one of my favourite films when I was a kid and I still watch it today! The jetsons movie is a movie that all kids will love! If you have not seen it yet, i HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you watch it!",10
87,I've seen the future and it is good!,"I loved the Jetson family as I grew up. I wanted to see the movie, but I wish that Janet Waldo could have stayed as Judy. I wasn't used to Tiffany.

88,Typical Jetson Family Antics with One Eye Popping Psychedelic Song,"Despite the Fact that the ""Hanna-Barbera"" Animation Studios Scored with Prime Time Hits like ""The Flintstones"" and had a Gaggle of other Characters become Household Names like ""The Jetsons"", ""Huckleberry Hound"", ""Yogi Bear"", and others, They will Forever be given a Dishonorable Mention as the Studio that Killed ""Full Animation"" Glory.The ""Fleischer"" Studio (creators of Popeye and Betty Boop), ""Warner Brothers"" (Bugs, Daffy, etc.), had Made Wonderful Fully Animated Cartoons for Decades, but when Sixties Television Came along ""Art"" was No Longer the First Concern, it was, You Guessed it, Economy. So the Cheap and it Looked it, Hanna-Barbera Flat Animation Won over.Not to be Stifled by this Limitation, Jay Ward came Up with ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" with Incredible Witty Scripts and Characters, and Blew Hanna-Barbera Off TV Screens and Showed Them for what they were. Quicky, Cheap, Superficial Non-Art.""The Jetsons"" and the Rest of the Studio Lineup did have a Modicum of Charm and Except for the Aforementioned ""Jay Ward"" Studios, It was All there was for Kids and Grownup Kids at the Time on the Tube (new productions). This Feature Length Movie was made Thirty Years After the Fact and is an OK Time Waster for Fans of ""The Jetsons"" Family. The Most Controversy for Fans was Replacing Janet Waldo as the Voice of ""Judy Jetson"" with Pop Star ""Tiffany"". A Few of Her Songs are Included in the Film for the Modern Audiences. There is One Song, ""You and Me"", that is a Show-Stopping, Psychedelic, Extravagance that is Atypical of the Usual Uninspired Animation from the Studio. The Song and the Visuals just Rock.Other than that bit on Inspiration, this is Typical Jetsonsawith an Environmental, Almost Socialistic, Storyline. Overall, It can be Enjoyed by Fans and Non-Fans alike if Nothing that Special.",7
89,Why does it always come down to voice casting?,"I have a lot of nostalgia for The Jetsons. The cartoon was one of my favorites as a child in the 1980s. I don't have that same nostalgia for the movie or even remember when I actually saw it for the first time. I decided to watch it to see if I wanted to buy the newly released Blu-Ray version.The Good: The animation is wonderful. The artists took the look right from the cartoon and gave it a boost for the big screen. The story is also nice and fits in with the world of the Jetsons. Daws Butler, the original voice of Elroy, sadly passed away before the movie was made but his replacement does a decent job. Otherwise most of the original voice cast is here, but more on that later. The musical score is well done, the iconic theme is heard throughout in different variations.Not So Good: It always seems to come down to the voice cast when cartoons are turned into feature films. As I said most of the cast from the show are in the movie. Sadly Mel Blanc (Spacely) and George O'Hanlon (George) died during production and another actor finished their parts. I didn't notice this with Mr. Spacely but there are several scenes where George's voice was much different. I certainly don't blame the studio for this. But my biggest issue is what they did to Judy Jetson's character.The original voice actor, Janet Waldo, recorded all her dialog for Judy only to be replaced by singer Tiffany. Of course Tiffany doesn't sound anything like the Judy we know and love, and the volume of songs make the movie feel like a vehicle for the singer's career. They should have kept Janet for the voice work and let Tiffany sing the songs, either as herself animated or just for the soundtrack. I would love to see the movie with Janet Waldo's voice restored but I'm guessing that is a pipe dream.Summary: They did a lot of good things with the Jetsons movie but the studio screwed it up by replacing one of the iconic voice cast with a popular singer for the time. Maybe I'll give it another watch and change my feelings in the future.Hollywood has kept this trend going with other cartoon properties. They just don't trust the property enough to let it speak for itself, they have to attach big name actors to it. Ugh!",6
90,Faithful to the orginal TV show but isn't out of this world,"George Jetson (voiced by George Hanlon) is a lazy operative and has been shipped off with his family to work at a deep space mining colony that makes cogs, but finds that someone or something is sabotaging the operation.What was intended as a re-boot feature animated film by Hanna Barbera of the classic 1960s cartoon sitcom series misfired and bombed as sadly the original TV cartoon series did. However the original 'The Jetsons' did become the inspiration for the more successful 'Futurama' cartoon TV series. It does benefit from being faithful to the original 60s show but with added modern pop songs, videos and references.",4
91,Saw this when it came out.,"I forget if I saw this in theatres or when it came to video, but I definitely saw it as a kid in the 90s shortly after it's release. I even owned the VHS tape, which might be where I first saw it. This movie was the world to me at the time, since the Jetsons was one of the few cartoons I liked besides Ninja Turtles and a few others (like the Super Mario brothers cartoon and live action show mix, and Captain N which I never saw more than one or two episodes of but loved).I really wish we made more movies like this back then, but maybe that's this movie was so special to me.",10
92,Boring.,"I'll admit. Jetsons: The Movie is NOT really the WORST animated film anyone has ever seen, and it's not as bad as ANY movie with Adam Sandler in it, but it's still bland, lazy, generic, boring, and very unfunny. I feel bad for Judy Jetson, because I can tell that in this movie, she is not the cutest blonde teenage girl in Orbit City that we all grew up with and had a crush on throughout our childhood. Tiffany is a good singer, but as the voice of Judy, she's dreadful. I don't mind a replacement actress for Judy Jetson, it just isn't supposed to be winy. Jetsons: The Movie sucks. At least it's not as bad as Strange Magic or Cool World. The only thing I mostly like in this movie is the animation, which is shockingly the best part of the whole movie. Other than that, this movie sucks. Giving the Jetsons a movie of their own for theaters was a great idea, it just never worked.",4
93,Spaced Out.,"Jetsons: The Movie (1990): Dir: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera / Voices: George O'Hanlon, Penny Singleton, Patrick Zimmerman, Tiffany, Mel Blanc: From the company that had tremendous success with The Flintstones, which dealt with a stone age family, comes a futuristic family. The Jetsons is headed by George who struggles to gain approval from his greedy boss Mr. Spacely. He is late for work again but is surprisingly promoted to vice president of Spacely Sprockets and has to move to another location to ""press the button"" at the plant there. Central plot regards the sabotaging of the factory and the reasons several vice presidents have quit. Despite the simplistic plot this is better written and much more entertaining than it first appears. It has the famous Hanna Barbera stamp plus it has characters that are targets of the puns. George Jetson gets caught up in the job and neglects what is important, like his family. Jane is his smart and supportive wife. Elroy is his young son engrossed in ""spaceball"" where his big move is ""the elevator."" Judy is the teenage daughter struggling with romance and acceptance. Astro is the lovable accepting loyal dog, and Rosie the Robot is the mindful maid. This is the final film for George O'Hanlon and Mel Blanc who passed away and left a legacy. For those who enjoyed the classic cartoon will likely engage in this space age hocus. Score: 8 / 10",8
94,Awesome soundtrack.,"Right off the bat, I have to say that this has a AWESOME soundtrack. Although a Hanna-Barbera production, it takes a kind of Disney ""musical"" approach with animated song sequences - but with contemporary production with the likes of Tiffany and others providing power ballads, pop-rock, swingin' beats and cheesy rap.The animation is perfect. The colors are magnificent (e.g. During Judy's song sequence at the new mall). The minimally used CGI is inoffensive. There was an era when CGI complemented cel animation rather than dominating it, and Jetsons: The Movie fits into that happy medium. If there's one issue I took, it was that I initially felt the light shading on the characters were a tad overdone. You quickly get used to it though.HOWEVER: The plot and story aren't all that. The plot resolves too easily at the end and therefore feels somewhat unsatisfying. Perhaps it could be argued that, as a kids' film, the story didn't need to be too complicated. Well maybe ... but Jetsons presents itself more as a family franchise than a children's one.I think the film should have focused itself more as an audiovisual feast and perhaps added just one more song. Then I'd rate it higher. It has much going for it, but is frustratingly flawed. A hidden gem that needed a little polishing for it to truly shine.",6
95,not a fan,"It's late 21st century. Spacely Sprockets and Spindles' new asteroid mining colony is being sabotaged. After the latest VP for the plant goes missing after three others, Cosmo Spacely sends Geroge Jetson and his family to the colony as the new head of the plant. George's job is to push the start button.The Jetsons are a bit before my time. Even as a child, I never watched the reruns while I did watch the reruns of The Flinstones. The Jetsons don't seem funny to me and much too bland. The family seems to exist in the superficiality of the mall universe in a superficial way. So I come to this with no nostalgia at all. In fact, it's somewhat anti-nostalgia to me. The first part is pretty bland. Once they get to the colony, there is a slice of Scooby Doo adventures which is a little interesting. I can do without the singing. This was a time when the pencil drawn animation gets mixed with rudimentary CG inserts. It's a temporary transition in animation. The drawn animation is too TV for theatrical release and CG doesn't fit the franchise. There is a dark subject matter about mining's destruction of the local people and it tackles it as well as can be expected in a kids movie. I come to this with low expectations and that's what I get for the most part.",4
96,the future comes,"""Jetsons: The Movie"" obviously couldn't be exactly like the series, due to changing mores and consciousness in the intervening decades (i.e., Jane now had to be more than just a wife). The basic message - the rights of indigenous people - is worthy, although other productions have done a better job with it. Naturally, the music is as '80s as can be (to be certain, Judy's voice artist had a song spoofed by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic).Basically, the movie was pretty much what I expected. Cosmo Spacely (voiced by Mel Blanc in his final role) needs to get listed as one of the most vicious bosses in popular culture, alongside Thurston Howell and Monty Burns.",5
97,The story of Reinhold Messners Nanga Parbat climb – according to Reinhold Messner,"Much has been speculated about the authenticity of ""Nanga Parbat"": critics complained that the film is solely based on the memories of Reinhold Messner, which often conflict with the memories of other participants of that fateful 1970 expedition.But, apart from the authenticity question, the film optically leaves little to be desired: snow and ice covered mountains, filmed breathtaking and flawless (some viewers even say, there was too little of the landscape photography). Indeed, Joseph Vilsmeier (""Bergkristall"") knows how to impressively film nature and rigid landscapes. Never known as brilliant film-maker, Vilsmeier knows how to routinely produce quick, cheap and efficient films-for-TV director and knows how to handle his landscape-photography.The weakest link among the actors is actor Karl Markovics, or rather his portrayal of expedition leader Karl Maria Herligkoffer: whether the portrayal is accurate (Messner had been fighting many bitter legal battles until Herligkoffers death in 1991) or fictional (which many expedition members claim), I cannot tell. But Markovics, known to German/Austrian TV-viewers as ""Inspector Stockinger"" plays the role like it was a caricature of 'The Fuehrer': a man stuck firmly in the 1930's ethos, throwing ""blood and honour"" speeches; you'd almost expect him to wear a brown uniform and give a Sieg Heil-salute any minute. Only later, once Messner and his brother have started their fateful journey, do we see some humanity but by that time we've already identified the character Herligkoffer as some leftover fascist.In contrast stands the figure of Florian Stetters Reinhold Messner who, at the beginning of the movie, faces his ""nemesis"" Herligkoffer like a Christ-like figure; marked by his Nanga Parbat experience and walking on crutches, yet dignified, righteous, victorious even. Yes, Reinhold Messner is primarily known for his expeditions and only secondarily for his larger than life ego. Alas (for both Messner and the audience), Stetter isn't the actor to carry a movie – especially not a movie about a larger than life figure like Messner. His performance reeks of television routine, rattling down his lines, leaving the audience to wonder why they should cheer for such protagonist. Same goes for Andreas Tobias (playing Messners doomed brother Guenther), who had appeared in a number of TV-series and production prior to ""Nanga Parbat"" and nothing much since. Well, perhaps acting isn't meant for everybody.What's left are some beautiful filmed mountain climbs – especially during the first part of the film; beware: if you're not comfortable with great heights, this movie might not be for you – and an often riveting mountaineer-drama. Drama because if you're looking for an authentic documentations of the actual events, you might be disappointed. If authenticity is what you're looking for, watch 2007's ""To The Limit"".I'd give the film generous 6 points from 10.",6
98,"Just as I expected, not what I hoped for","""Nanga Parbat"" is a German movie from 5 years ago that runs for 100 minutes and was directed by Joseph Vilsmaier, a filmmaker for many decades already. It deals with the Messner Brothers climbing the mountain in the title and is based on real events. I am fairly certain that most Germans over the age of 20 still know today who Reinhold Messner is, even if he is already in his 70s now. And most are probably also vaguely aware of his most heartbreaking expedition, the one during which he lost his brother. And that is the one this film is about. I am probably a bit biased here. First of all, I never found Messner likable and second of all, I never understood the concept of faster, further, higher and you probably have to in order to understand Messner's efforts or a appreciate a movie that centers around him. Death certainly was an option and I cannot see why anybody would risk his life for this one, especially as it does nothing good to other people. Yes it may have to do with personal goals, but still, in this context I do not understand why this would be a personal goal for anybody.Florian Stetter does a decent job as the lead actor, but I found Markovics almost as memorable. He is good as usual and always fun to watch. Like I said before, the climbing scenes did nothing for me. The snow-covered mountains may have been a good watch, but in terms of the story or the drama I did not really care. Also the brother relationship was not elaborated on convincingly in my opinion and this may have been the only aspect that could have saved the movie for me. So yeah, I thought this would become a disappointment, but still gave it a chance. It came as I expected, mostly because the topic is fairly unappealing to me. If you like these kind of movies, check out the (in my opinion) equally underwhelming ""Nordwand"" after watching ""Nanga Parbat"". Seems to be a trend to use the mountains names for these films. Anyway, I do not recommend the watch. Maybe the best aspect is still the music as it comes from 2-time Academy Award winner Gustavo Santaolalla (""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Babel"").",4
99,Almost good mountaineering movie,"This is the real story of the ascension of one of the 8000m Himalayan peaks by Reinhold Messner (perhaps the greatest climbers of all times, and most certainly one of the very, very few that make it alive to an older age) and his brother.For those not familiar, the Nanga Parbat peak is considered perhaps the most dangerous 8000m peak of all, because the risk of avalanches is particularly high here.The mountain scenes are almost good, there is real footage of the Nanga Parbat peak, local mountain scenes are not particularly realistic, but not too bad.What is good in this movie, and something I couldn't figure by the Reinhold's book on the subject, is the pain they went through. They had little food, no climbing gear, and especially no warm clothes with them. Equipped this way, they had to bivouac (basically to sit down on the snow and try to sleep without any protection from the cold or blowing snow) two nights, above 6500m. That is terrible, terrible hard to endure. The scenes when they bivouac are hard to look at, because we image what it must have been. I had a few nights of sleep in cold but not freezing temperatures and it's awful, I cannot image what those guys went through. Looking at the film now, I think it shows what kind of a person Reinhold is, this must be the reason he survived through all his altitude climbs, he must be a very rare type of person with an extremely tough and enduring type of organism.This movie also remembers me about the first climber to summit the Nanga Parbat peak, Hermann Buhl, who also had to bivouac near the summit in a standing position for a whole night before the descent.Finally, this is not just a mountaineering film, as the climbing scenes began only at half of the projection.",9
100,Imagine.,"I finally got an opportunity to watch Nanga Parbat, which was dedicated to the Messner brothers. You do not witness exciting movie scenes in the first half hour, but you are definitely not bored. Then the tempo drops considerably and the film becomes too far from realism. I can say that I find the performances of the players inadequate and it is impossible to establish an emotional connection. The only good thing was the childhood scenes of the Messner brothers. This movie could have been better. Unfortunately I had to close the movie before it was finished.",4
101,Best parts are filmed in Pakistan,"I have a limited understanding of this film so am writing this review only because there were no other reviews yet. My understanding is limited because I do not speak German and apparently there has been no release of this film with English subtitles, or at least I could not find one (I did find some English subtitles on the internet but they were both badly out of synch and a mashed Google translation from Russian!). Hence, some of the dialog was rather lost on me and very likely some of the drama as well.I primarily viewed this film not for the story but in the hopes of spectacular mountain scenery and spectacular mountain climbing sequences. There was some of this, but not nearly enough for my tastes, or I would have given the film a higher rating. A better film (also German but available with English subtitles) is North Face (Nordwand, IMDb #tt0844457) which is both very dramatic and has very spectacular mountain climbing sequences (although I still wanted more there as well).To my mind, the best parts of the film took place in Pakistan and in the Pakistani Himalayan foothills. Very nice and interesting photography, and I gleaned from the credits that it was actually filmed there. I love seeing exotic locales like that, which I am unlikely to see otherwise, and I found the film worth my time just for that. I would watch it again if I could find a version with good English subtitles.",7
102,Amateurish,"The true story about the Meissner brothers is so exciting in itself, that it ought to have been possible to make a really suspenseful, exciting, dramatic and emotional movie out of it. This is, however, not the case.The movie is amateurish, low budget (to its disadvantage), and even at times boring. Also, things were not explained enough for those of us who are not into mountaineering, and who did not know the story of these brothers beforehand.I got the impression that this was merely a collection of loose scenes, made as illustrations in moving pictures to a story, that the audience was already supposed to know.",4
103,Technically a disaster - nice panoramic views,"From a technical standpoint this movie is a layman's work in many regards:* Music: Musical score doesn't enhance emotion in any of the scenes. It only serves as a boring, easily written, lame absense of silence. I cannot stand to hear this score any longer. Whenever my mind wants to compare this zero level score to a score of older films, like Luis Trenker's composer Giuseppe Becce's score, it becomes unbearable to me that this is supposed to be the new level of a composer's prowess.* Actors: I brings me to tears that none of them apparently learned their acting skills. None of them shows appropriate facial expressions, none of them can speak like an actor. No emphasis, no stress, no accent, no innotation. Just a common man's speak. And no mimic. (OK, the priest at the end of the movie, Matthias Habich, is a well regarded exception to the crew.)* Sound design: Too may slightly coughs, too many hissy fits. I guess they added them due to the absence of an appropriate musical score. It's like being forced to listen to Darth Vater infamously and inappropriately crying ""Nooooooo"" over and over again.On the other hand: The camera is marvellous, illumination, color timing and post-production are great to watch, too.The aeroplane should have been rendered more majestically. In the movie it's just ""some vehicle"", it's not an important, elevating begin of their dangerous journey.Now that I've seen the movie, I wish someone gave me the raw cut, an editor, a decent composer, a small orchestra, and a bunch of good dubbing actor's voices! I would completely redo the movies audio to create a movie that's emotionally poignant and great to watch.This current movie is a pain to watch and appears to be a laboured students' work only.",3
104,Dispersed...,"They could leave death as an outcome and surprise, but in the initial scenes we already have the weight of guilt falling on the brother, I took pity on this family... Dreams realized and uninterrupted by fatality, perhaps the right word is stubbornness, or determination ... story was more interesting than the film, too dispersed...",7
105,What a shame,"It's an absolute shame that this movie is the legacy Reinhold Messner wishes to leave of himself.Despite desperately trying to portray himself as an idealistic hero, he comes out as a shallow egomaniac.If anything it makes you question the narrative protagonist wants us to remember, which under the guise of heroic achievement is just a bunch of baloney.The movie itself is a bag of cheap tricks cobbled together on a budget. The play is dull, characters are flat, music is out of place.Should you watch it? If you had any illusions about Reinhold, you should. Be prepared to have your childhood idol crushed.",3
106,Hugh Jackman is everything!,"No denying the fact that hugh jackman makes this movie. He is charming, gallant, and everything a 19th century duke should be and more. His character Leopold has the perfect ""fish out of water"" charm and curiosity without being repetitive or annoying . While I usually like Meg Ryan, her character Kate is quite bland and lacks depth. The Kate/Leopold romance feels forced there's no real chemistry. But overall it's different, fun, and at least worth one watch.",6
107,Fine movie...could have been better though,"I'm a fan of Meg Ryan and think that she's one of the best there is in Hollywood right now. Yet, I believe that it was HUGH JACKMAN who stole the show in this movie. He is so charming and charismatic that you can hardly resist falling head over heels for him! Leopold is a duke from the 18th century who mistakenly lands up in the 21st century one day...and is obviously bewildered with everything he sees. He stays with the man who got him there at the first place, Stuart,Kate's (Meg Ryan) ex-boyfriend. Predictably, Leopold falls in love with Kate and she retaliates. Yet, he has to go back where he came from, and that poses a problem for their relationship. It's a cute movie, yet, I couldn't agree with the ending, though it was predictable. I just couldn't see eye to eye with the reasoning they gave us for the step Kate took. Okay movie...great if you have nothing else to do and like chick-flicks. That's exactly the reason I watched it. I liked it..but I've seen better by Meg Ryan.",8
108,"I had heard a lot of bad things about Kate & Leopold, but I must say that I was impressed.","I can understand why people would be put off by a movie like Kate & Leopold, even if only because it's a little TOO cute. Consider, for example, the scene early in the film, just after Stuart (Liev Schreiber) has accidentally brought Leopold (in a wonderful performance by Hugh Jackman) to the present day, and Kate (Meg Ryan) sticks her head in the window to see what's going on. When Meg Ryan is kneeling down and looking in the window in this scene, she is probably more adorable than I've ever seen her in any other movie, and she is without a doubt one of the most adorable actors working in Hollywood today. (spoilers) I can see that some people might be put off just by the sheer cuteness of things like this (of which the movie is full to the brim), as well as other things like the cheesiness of the conflict resolution, in which Kate literally takes a leap of faith off of the Brooklyn Bridge, with her ex-boyfriend as well as her brother urging her on even though each is fully aware that this will mean they will never see her again.
For my own part, I think that minor quibbles like these are easy to overlook just because of the sheer entertainment value of the movie and the fact that the time travel element (something that almost never fails to enthrall me) is so intriguing and well done. I love the part at the end when they see Kate in one of the pictures that Stuart took in 1873, meaning that the resolution includes her being sent back to that time to be with Leopold. Stuart tries in vain to explain this to Charlie (Breckin Meyer), Kate's younger brother, telling him that since in THEIR future they send Kate back to the past, then the future of that past includes Kate being their and searching for Leopold. Well, I can't really explain it any better than Stuart did.There was one other thing about the time travel element that I thought was really interesting but wasn't explored as well as it could have been. There is a part of the movie where Leopold discovers, to all sorts of astonished amazement, that his uncle's house (his own residence in 1873) still stands even in the futuristic New York in which he finds himself. This is also, by the way, the point where Kate begins to realize that this whole thing might not be an act after all. Leopold runs upstairs and finds a secret hiding place where he kept all of his most treasured possessions, which still remain as dusty relics. Something like this is usually a signpost that it is going to come back into play at some later point in the film, but I guess here it is only meant to show Kate that Leopold is for real after all. Later in the film, when Leopold is sent back to his own time, I was expecting Kate to run up to that room in his house and open the cupboard and find some sort of note or something that Leopold left for her to find there, but no such luck. Ah well.As a romantic comedy, Kate & Leopold certainly has its shortcomings given it's conveniently packaged ending, the fact that so many things are ignored just to get to that happy ending (such as how Charlie's date REALLY went and what ever happened with him and his acting career and his love life, etc, and the same goes for Stuart), but as a film it is enormously entertaining, well-written, and thought-provoking, which is exceedingly uncommon for a romantic comedy. While it's true that the movie takes place mainly in society that can produce digital cameras the size of matchboxes but can't get toasters to work properly, this is the kind of movie that spawns discussion, which is what great movies do. If nothing else, it is most certainly an in-depth look at the descent of chauvinism between the 19th Century and today, and provides a host of immensely valuable lessons for how men should act around women. I would certainly like to see a lot of these behaviors return to our modern society, so that we can remember that life is not composed solely of tasks, but tastes as well. Kate & Leopold holds that rare distinction of being a romantic comedy that is more beneficial for men than women.
Pay attention to this one, guys.",9
109,Cinematography and writing drew me in,"Honestly, my wife rented this and I wasn't planning on watching - but the luscious cinematography and some interesting writing drew me in.  Hugh Jackman sealed the deal with his totally straight portrayal - this guy's earning power can only go up!  Looking for some fluff and a laugh? It's better than most of the romantic comedy crap out there.  Not a waste of time if you are in the mood to have something wash over you.",8
110,A modern fairy tale for romantic souls,"Kate & Leopold is more or less a romantic comedy that has been done so many times before. Woman and man see each other and don't like each other. Than they fall in love, but destiny comes in between them. In the end they overcome all problems and will live happily ever after...It's exactly the same as always, but this time they have added an interesting extra ingredient to it. Kate, her brother, her ex and Leopold all live in New York. The only problem is that Leopold is from the 1870's, while the others live in the 21st century. Kate's brother has found a way to travel through time, meets Leopold and accidentally takes him with him to the 21st century. I guess I don't have to explain everything that happens afterward...Even though I'm not always a huge fan of romantic comedies, I have to admit that I had a good time watching this one. Thanks to the original approach, this movie is better than average. The actors are convincing, although I was surprised to see how easily a man from the 19th century adapted to the 21st. It never really seemed a shocking experience to him. If I had directed the movie, I would have accentuated it more... But hey, if you can see past that and you are a romantic soul, I'm sure that you'll love this modern fairy tale. You know it's impossible, but you would like to believe it. I give it a 7/10 for that.",7
111,I Admit I Liked This,"Kate and her actor brother live in N.Y. in the 21st Century. Her ex-boyfriend, Stuart, lives above her apartment. Stuart finds a space near the Brooklyn Bridge where there is a gap in time. He goes back to the 19th Century and takes pictures of the place. Leopold -- a man living in the 1870s -- is puzzled by Stuart's tiny camera, follows him back through the gap, and they both ended up in the present day.This could be dismissed as a romantic comedy, which in many ways it is. But it also has that science fiction, time travel element that will make it appeal to people (like myself) who may not be particularly interested in romantic comedies. We also have some great performances. Meg Ryan is alright (she has improved since the 1980s), and it is always nice to see Liev Schreiber.This is a film that needs reevaluation.",7
112,A 19th Century MacGyver!,"This movie kind of reminds me of Hayford Peirce's ""Napoleon Disentimed,"" when a con-man playing Napoleon invents champagne - this for me connects where there is a plausible yet apocryphal reference to Hugh Jackman's character inventing a modern-day convenience (Leopold - but a member of royalty did perform a type of invention; speaking under correction, but I think Philip II of Spain created the precursor to the current thermometer used nowadays)! The further irony was that Leopold was discovered by another would-be inventor, played to disarming effect by Liev Schreiber - which is a far cry from Liev's chilling performance in the remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" - and he is also the benighted ex-lover of Meg Ryan (Kate).Liev's character finally gets her to accept they have drifted apart when he delivered a quiet yet massive insult - this movie thrives on intellectual innuendo and bravura, as opposed to bravado... Leopold does a remarkable adaptation to modern day conveniences, even re-inventing a timed toaster using a rubber band, timer and bent fork - a veritable 19th century MacGyver! The transplanted and trans-timed Duke does not realise how attached he got to Kate until he realised her boss was being less than a gentleman about her promotion. So Leopold educated her employer on the finer points of French, La Boheme and geography - without laying a finger he scalded the man! It really is a fantasy picture, she still had her job, LOL!!! However, for me the highlight is when Kate's purse is stolen near Central Park. The whole film shows how a man should treat a woman - and even better, they used Sting's ""Until"" which was inspired by the tragedy of 9-11... It is one of the most romantic songs ever and the film is a timeless classic on the whole!",10
113,Solid rom-com with a side of time travel,"Kate McKay (Meg Ryan) is a throughly modern girl climbing the corporate ladder at her advertising company. Her ex Stuart (Liev Schreiber) lives below her apartment. He's been working on time travel, and finds a time portal to a specific 19th century date if one jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge. Leopold (Hugh Jackman)'s family is broke hoping he would marry into money. He comes to NY to select a wife, but instead chases the strange Stuart with a modern camera back to the present.This is a solid rom-com all the way. Meg Ryan has still got it. She plays the cute girl who just can't fall for the right guy. Hugh Jackman is a dashing fresh air in a world without manners or chivalry. No matter what the evidence, she can't accept that he's a time traveler. Hugh Jackman is a heartthrob. They create the perfect and unabashedly traditional romance with a side of time travel.",7
114,"Charming, though could have been much better (Possible spoilers)","Dear folks who hated this movie,If you didn't like Bewitched, or Dark Shadows, or oldie's but goodies, like Here Comes Mr. Jordon, or I Married a Witch, you aren't going to like Kate and Leopold. It's a fantasy which makes it your broccoli and spinach salad with cod liver oil dressing. So, please move on and let the rest of us enjoy it.This is not to say the movie is without flaws. It's got them. K&L has been out for a couple of years now and people still complain about Leopold's suit and plot holes and the supposed incest. Interestingly, when I first read a very early blurb about the movie it said that Leopold was from 200 years in the past, which would have put him in about the Regency era. The 200 years would have also pushed the 'incest' concern back another three or four generations. It would also have explained his Regency style getup. The folks who were doing the counting on this incest thing would have to have at least admitted that at 6 or 7 generations removed, Kate and Start would have only shared something like 1/138th blood. That's a bit less than the 1/4 it would be for second cousins marrying, etc. If you keep it at 100 or so years separation, it would still be around 1/16th shared blood. But even that kind of thinking means we're getting away from 'it's a fantasy, folks!'I have a few personal gripes about the movie. When it was out at the theater I saw it twice. Not a usual occurrence for me, even with Hugh Jackman's hunky persona. Frankly, during the first viewing, I could not get past Meg Ryan's hair. I was literally stunned by it. She's such a pretty woman, it amazes me that she thinks (or thought) that the Cookie the Clown haircut was cute. Not! Ms. Ryan, what were you thinking? Was this a mid-life crisis reaction?I've gotten used to Ms. Ryan's hair now and just don't see it anymore. But her performance, seemed to be Meg Ryan phoning is as Meg Ryan. Hugh Jackman was utterly charming as Leopold and so was the young actor who played Kate's brother. Some of their scenes together are the best in the movie.I though the use of profanity was overdone. My reaction is not out of prudishness (I can use the f-word and a heap of others when my car has a flat or won't start or I'm stuck in traffic, etc.) But it seems to me to lessen the authenticity of a character's intelligence. (Think about that the next time you overhear someone swearing continually in line at the grocery store.) It surprised me that Leopold didn't object to Kate's constant swearing (she was, after all, a lady) or that he didn't make a comment on it in general. I didn't feel he was reacting within the social attitudes of his own time. Even if it is a fantasy, he's not going to acclimate to our times all *that* quickly.I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so had no problem with the supposed 'incest' line. It's fantasy. And it's a paradox to begin with. During the time frame Stuart and Kate are in, Kate is NOT his several times removed great-grandmother. Think about *that* end of it.  So, shared blood aside, I can't say I'm sure who it was who was getting their knickers in a twist over that. That all said, it is a charming movie that could have been a blockbuster hit the likes of Sleepless but is not. I'm not sure where the fault lies in that. The Cookie the Clown haircut? Direction? The last minute/panic edit? Certainly in some of the writing. At this date none of that is going to change, so simply enjoy the movie for itself. There are far worse ways to spend two hours.(6/10)",7
115,Cute but dumb,"Liev Schreiber (badly used and miscast) travels from NYC 2002 to NYC 1862 (the how and why are never really explained). While coming back he accidentally brings a 19th century duke Leopold (Hugh Jackman) with him. Leopold meets Kate (Meg Ryan) and...well, you can figure it out from there.The movie looks beautiful, is VERY romantic and Jackman is incredibly handsome, sexy, funny...God, those eyes of his...but this movie is really dumb. There are some plot turns that are unbelievable (the time travel is never explained; Jackman saves Ryan's purse from a mugger on horseback--literally; Jackman gets used to the 21st century way too quickly; do New Yorkers always leave their windows open so someone can clamber in off the fire escape?). Also Ryan has played this part once too often--she's getting too old and (sadly) she looks it. However, Breckin Meyer is very good and funny as her brother.The only reason to see the movie is Jackman--he's just great. And it IS cute. So, it's worth seeing.",6
116,enjoyable fluff with extraordinary character,"This movie wouldn't really be anything to write home about. You could call it science fiction because it's about time travel, but any serious science fiction buff would know better. But, there's something absolutely extraordinary about this movie that has me watching it again and again. I wasn't a big Hugh Jackman fan when I watched this movie. I suppose I'm still not. I'm too old for that kind of thing, but the character Leopold has a stillness, a quality of listening and putting other people (man or woman) first. He demonstrates an etiquette that is not at all stiff, that is less about precise forms and rules than about a genuine care for other people. I go back and watch Kate and Leopold when I wish I knew somebody who cared that much for me.",7
117,Great Idea.. Average Script.. Weak Movie !,"Let me see: (Meg Ryan) + (Hugh Jackman) + time travel + romantic comedy + A (Sting) song = something definitely magical. But unfortunately, it wasn't!I'm nuts about the main idea. (Hugh Jackman) here is an actual prince charming. He is also the elevator's inventor, so he has both heart and brains (and in Jackman's case muscles too). As for representing the lost romance and chivalry, it's the perfect character, and when you push him into the future, aka: our world, then it's the perfect idea. However, the ""world"" of this movie was very scanty.Mainly look at the dramatic conflict. In fact, there isn't one! Since (Meg Ryan)'s boyfriend left her from the start, so filling for the dashing, handsome, well-bred, mugger-chaser inventor would be not only easy, but basically axiomatic. So, is it about the endless ironies between the old age and the new age's technology? No, since the movie summarized it in brief sequence. So, is it about the deep irony between romantic age, and phony materialistic one? Maybe, but they did it simply through the making of the TV commercial. It looked like another kind of angel-in-our-house movies where one visitor gives ultimate happiness to his troubled hosts then leaves. But did that fit whether the comic or the romantic part?? I think wholly NOT.You'll feel hastiness. Although the main irony is super, but the movie's ironies weren't. The comedy was careless; I can't remember one good laughable situation. The dialogue was a crime as totally unfunny and untalented, except for the monologue of (Liev Schreiber) at the hospital which was philosophically well put, but surpassed anything that was written for any other character, and with its high level exposed all the low level of the rest of the dialogue! I didn't feel the love story between the title's characters, or the urge of that being impossible. All what we had was just light touches that didn't convince me; like the swift story of the unseen lonely neighbor, the love story of the lead's brother (that we witnessed on the phone!), the concept of capturing the time or else, because this criminally remiss script just wasted it all.Look at what seemed as brilliant situations like the stopping of all the world's elevators; despite the imaginative spirit, the script didn't go with it to anywhere, so what about this unique romance between 2 persons from 2 ages?! Therefore the ending was too happy and too dreamy to fabricated extent, without much of details or difficulties. So as a whole it went astray without strong feelings or good meanings. And the romance eventually seemed superficial.Director (James Mangold) was executing a bland TV episode. I felt fake tenderness from him. Especially when the only romantic scene (the waltz) was just accumulated well-arranged shots without effective emotions. Yes, the cinematography and the warm lighting were a bit sentimental at that scene, but the complete atmosphere was so unimpressionable.This can't compete with (Meg Ryan)'s nice legacy of romantic comedies. Originally, it can't compete with the standard of its idea, or even its own title as a movie about (Kate) and (Leopold). It was really ambitious one that promised something like what an old classic movie would present about memorable couple, however this movie delivered nothing.The 2 leads were like 2 clever singers without music or song. It's pathetic to watch shinning stars like them, with possible chemistry, starring a movie that's suffering of self-induced abortion! In the case of (Jackman), the type of the role was attractive, yet not the role in particular. (Ryan) didn't give us anything new, since the script didn't give her anything. It's the bad paradox of having productive people through unproductive work.I hated (Schreiber), despite whatever he could reach, he got nothing to do with a romantic comedy, let alone being younger than (Ryan). I hated dealing with (Sting)'s masterpiece (Until), which was nominated for an Oscar, by putting it only at the closing credits, plus not even using its fascinating melody into the movie's music score the way (John Williams) did in (Sabrina)'s soundtrack with another (Sting)'s masterpiece (Moonlight). I liked (Meg)'s chic clothes, that was cuter than the movie itself!I'm sad to say it, but as a romantic comedy it lacks romance and comedy. It was all out of keeping with (Sting)'s (Until) which was more masterly than the whole thing. It's devastating to hear it, and imagine a better movie for it!",5
118,Well Done !,I must admit the characters in Kate & Leopold were superb.! Meg Ryan was great and Hugh Jackman .... incredible.  This is the kind of movie you'd skip a night out in town on a saturday night to watch. This is definitely for the women out there who still believe in true romance. I'm one of them ! I really don't mind watching Hugh Jackman in more comedy romances. Leopold will sweep you off your feet and steal your heart away.!,10
119,Fabulous!,"Definitely a must see for guys & gals who believe romance still lives.  Great lessons for all of us, and very much a feel good movie.",10
120,My heart!,One of my favorite movies of all time! So heart-warming & beautiful!,10
121,Breckin and Hugh,"I wonder if Meg Ryan never gets tired of being Meg Ryan. She's been acting in the same movie for 20 years now and, no matter how much I like her, it's getting a bit old. Usually Meg could save the worst movie with being her cute self, but the thing is: Meg isn't cute anymore. Not with that hair, and not with that character. Luckily there's Hugh Jackman who does a Colin Firth, and Breckin Meyer who gets the funniest moment of the movie. (`I can do Canadian too!'). This movie gets a 6, (= ok for once but not really one to rewatch over and over again",5
122,have serious issues with the end! *********contains spoiler*********,"Even overlooking several major flaws, this movie still isn't very good. I'm willing to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, so I can forgive all the time-travel questions this movie raises. Furthermore I'm used to movies portraying people as falling in love in less than a week and assuming that that is a solid basis for a lifelong marriage - so I can't really fault this film for that too. My biggest problem was the way Meg Ryan's character was portrayed and how quickly she was able to throw away her entire life for some distant past that I don't think she quite appreciated what her new life would entail. Why did people (both Leopold and her boss) accuse her of being ""manly"" and ""unfeminine""?  Because she was assertive, good at her job, career-oriented? I found this highly offensive! Furthermore, even accepting that she had fallen in love with someone (in a week!) and that she was not that interested in keeping her own life (w/ a promotion, the love of her brother, her friends, etc.) -- how on earth could she decide (in less than 23 minutes) to travel back to live in 1876? (without even hearing from Leopold on his thoughts on the matter!)  If she's thought to be ""unfeminine"" and ""manly"" in this day and age, can you imagine what it would've been like back then?  Has she considered whether being with Leopold is worth giving up her rights?  The right to vote, to wear pants, to work, etc. Were women at the time allowed to go outside unchaperoned, own property of any kind, even get divorces?  Did they still wear girdles and other sorts of insane fashions she will be expected to adopt?  I admit my knowledge of the past was sketchy, but I'd be worried about things like indoor plumbing, the state of medicine/hospitals at the time, etc.
The false romanticization of the past is nauseating.  We're supposed to think it's better because men were more ""gentlemanly"" back then.  It's not impossible to find polite, well-behaved men in this day and age - who also agree with feminist principles!I could have handled the ending if he had come back to live with her in the present instead of her having to go back and give up her life for him.  It seems as if he would've adjusted better to today's society than she to his. (It already sounded as if he was unhappy with his life back then, and other than his connection to Otis, had no personal ties).",3
123,Silly premise but a fun movie if you like rom-coms.,"Aside from the ridiculous premise and tremendous number of plot holes, if you enjoy rom-coms, you might enjoy this one. Why? Hugh Jackman. He steals every scene. Well, OK. As silly as the premise is, it's still fun. Who doesn't like a little time-travel story?Meg Ryan does her usual thing, which borders on boring, and her character's ""style"" isn't one of her best looks. Whoever did her hair, which looked badly cut and stringy, should have been fired. And whoever was in charge of her wardrobe should have been fired as well. It was the drabbest and most unattractive wardrobe I think I've ever seen for the female lead of a rom-com. In one scene, she's wearing brown suede boots with a blue-grey silk evening gown. Seriously? Do they not think viewers notice those things?OK, enough of dissing Ryan. I will say that in addition to Jackman doing an excellent job with his role, all of the supporting cast does an excellent job with theirs. Ryan is the only ""bad actor"" in this movie. If Leopold likes lovely women with class and grace, I can't understand why he would fall for Kate considering the way she's played by Ryan because her ""Kate"" has neither.So if you love Hugh Jackman and can take Meg Ryan without too much difficulty, you'll likely enjoy this little romp. The story doesn't have a lot of ""meat"" to it, but there's definitely much worse out there in this genre.",6
124,Time-travelling romance - pity it's one-sided ...,"Romantic comedies are, by definition, very predictable affairs, so it's always good to come across one that tries to add something new or shake things up a bit. This one tries a love spanning one hundred years, thanks to time travel (hey, far weirder things have happened in movieland). Leopold, dashingly handsome 19th century Duke (Hugh Jackman) is (unwillingly) contemplating marriage. 21st century career woman Kate (Meg Ryan) is climbing the corporate ladder at an advertising company, whilst her love life is somewhat less successful. But time gets twisted when Kate's ex-boyfriend Stuart (Liev Schrieber) finds a portal into the 19th century - and after an ill-advised visit there, winds up bringing home an unexpected guest; Leopold, of course.Hijinks ensue as the gentlemanly and courageous Leopold navigates his way through 21st century New York, befriending Kate's brother Charlie (Breckin Meyer) and beginning a romance with Kate. And of course all ends happily in the end. I'll start with the good stuff: Jackman is absolutely charming, playing it straight as the fish-miles-inland-never-mind-out-of-water and succeeding admirably. You can't help but love him and believe in him. Breckin Meyer does nicely in a supporting role. Schrieber is essentially a plot device to move the story forward, but gets a few comic and touching moments that a less talented actor might have let fall by the wayside.And what about our other romantic lead? >Sigh< I've never been a fan of Meg Ryan, but I'll try and be fair as possible. But to be honest, I didn't warm at all to her character. I get that Kate is a driven career woman, but what a high price she pays for it. ""You're like a man"" her boss says approvingly (huh?) but she isn't - she simply comes across as a bitchy, bad-tempered and cold woman (guess I'm losing the fairness battle) and to be honest, doesn't stand a chance in the popularity battle with Jackman's Leopold. And then she tosses her career away for a happy ending with her Duke, marriage and setting up a 19th century home. I do wish a career woman would be allowed to keep her job AND her guy just for once, rather than heading off to become the ""little woman"".Okay, rant over. It's great escapism, and worth seeing for Jackman alone, but I doubt it will linger long in the memory.",6
125,Really sweet Christmas movie with a good message,"Lucia wants to be a ""julemand"" (Christmas man = Santa Claus), but she can't because ""only males can do that. It's tradition"". When she's given a task she has to complete in order to get accepted, it's only because the leaders of the school believes she can't succeed.This task leads to a wonderful story about believing in yourself and a great message of gender equality without being to preachy.
I really enjoyed this movie. And the quality of the sets, costumes and production was really good!",8
126,Everyone can be what they want to,"This sweet christmas story is about the danish Santa Claus' daughter who wants to become a santa, but the rules says that only boys can be it, that's a tradition. Young Lucia won't give up and keeps going strong for what she believe in believing in that christmas miracle, but how it ends you should watch for urself.All I can say is that this movie really brings out that christmas spirit. Merry Christmas.",9
127,Nice effort with nice productions values.,"Made for very little money, NAUTILUS is actually a fun science-fiction film combining elements from 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, CRACK IN THE WORLD and DIE HARD.  On the level of a Roger Corman styled flick, the film has impressive productions values and some very nice miniature work.  Richard Norton of the Jackie Chan films is a good, athletic hero and as a middle of the week video rental, this flick delivers the goods in an unpretentious way.",6
128,Disappointing but not a total loss,"The Cover for the DVD shows a very impressive Submarine. Unfortunately, the sub in the movie is a very different and extremely inferior sub, nothing like the cover picture. Even though this is a sub movie, 98% of the action take place between humans far from the sub. No Monsters, No Fantasy Elements, just mid 90's direct to video really bad action, with less than stellar players. If this movie had just added some good CGI stuff, it would have been much better. This movie has an ecological message to it, and while important, always brings a movie down. And of course, even though the name of the movie is Nautilus and is about a sub, there is zero connection between it, and the writings of Jules Verne. (What we need are some direct to video/DVD Captain Nemo movies that hold no relation to the books, other than the character and his sub, fighting lots of monsters and stuff.) This movie was less than stellar, but I did manage to make it all the through with out turning it off. The actors failed, but the story did make me want to see how it ended.",4
129,Nostalgia Made Me Like It More,"Being made in 2000 really surprised me actually, because it looks and has the same vibe as a film made in the early 90s, possibly sooner.It reminded me very much of films that I used to watch with my Granddad from that time period too in terms of plot, the kind of ""science"" going on, the special effects, everything. Even the same kind of lines, some of them being cheesy. It's decent with how it uses the Sci-fi elements such as time travel, and has some nice touches here and there.So when I thought it was made sooner than 2000, my rating would have been higher, but with a note it was a product of its time. But I guess since it isn't, it drops a little, but if you know anyone who likes films from that time period. Then it could be an enjoyable watch.If you are expecting something more modern than what it offers, then you will be a little disappointed.",5
130,Candidate for worst movie of the year,"""Crack in the World"" meets ""Back to the Future"".  An appallingly bad movie, I dare anyone else to see it to the end.  I did, but I can't remember what happens.  There is one interesting scene where a scientist sees himself commit suicide in the future.  Don't think I've seen that before!",1
131,Action packed romp through time!,"While Nautilus may not have had the budget of some of the larger Hollywood projects, they story, action, and acting of the main stars propels this above most attempts at Sci-Fi cinema released. While much of the attention centers around the martial arts prowess of Richard Norton, attention needs to be placed on the actor that portrayed Raoul, the leader of the Eco-terrorism group Equinox. Now known as the host for popular shows such as Shop till you Drop and Outback Jack, Roberto shines in his role here as a man with a mission to save the planet. Showing acerbic wit and physical dexterity, his screen time was a highlight of this film.Action, Explosions, Intrigue, Time Travel, Martial Arts, what more could a movie buff ask for?",7
132,"Interesting, but dull","I first watched Nautilus a month ago, and I must say it was OK for a film that the sci-fi channel would probably air on TV constantly. The film is basically a time-travelling film (similar to Back to the Future) that involves saving the world from a untimely destructive event using a futuristic submarine. Richard Norton was OK in terms of acting, but overall all the characters were uninteresting and completely lacking in any depth. However, I thought that the whole concept of time travel in this film was interesting, but it unfortunately fails to achieve an amazing result, and in the end the plot was boring.I did however enjoy some elements of the film. The time-travelling submarine (probably called Nautilus) was quite interesting to look at (the CGI was quite good), and it gave the film a Jules Verne / 20'000 Leagues Under The Sea element, which I quite enjoyed. Sadly, the underwater craft is only seen in the film several times, and that disappointed me greatly. Overall, Nautilus is a sci-fi film that was interesting at first, but it became dull later on. I just wished they focused more on the submarine than fighting spies or the constant chatter about rubbish...",6
133,Norton keeps the movie afloat.,"When a big new drilling station named Prometheus is set to open out in the middle of the ocean, its main developer, Basim (Eschbach) hires Jack Harris (Norton) to be its head of security. This is needed because an eco-terrorist group named Equinox is threatening violent tactics to shut it down, because they believe it's not environmentally friendly. Just as Harris is dealing with these troublemakers, they get a message from the future in the form of a Star Wars-like hologram. Captain Brin (Kriesa) and his daughter Ariel (Wolfe) are planning to travel back in time on their submarine, the Nautilus, to stop the drilling station. They believe it will start a chain of events that will lead to catastrophic destruction and basically the end of the world. The developers, along with Harris, are skeptical, but the future-people are insistent. What then follows is a battle of wills and ideologies. Who will prevail? We can give you the bottom line on this one right away: the scenes with Richard Norton are worthwhile and entertaining. The scenes he does not appear in are boring and reach sloggish proportions. We could just end the review there, but we'll provide a few more of our humble thoughts. While Nautilus is not fast-paced, and is fairly typical of the DTV dreck that cluttered up the 2000's, it actually wasn't quite as bad as we were expecting it to be. We thought is was going to be an out-and-out sub slog, and were pleasantly surprised to find out there are some other elements mixed in.For example, the opening of the movie is decent, especially the introduction to Harris, Norton's character. The movie has a few mildly interesting ideas, but sadly not enough to propel a 90 minute feature along like the cinematic sub that it is. As usual for the B-movies of this time, there are plenty of actors that look like bigger names (but aren't), such as Brin, who looks like Sam Neill. There are scenes of actors calling out coordinates, which always make for thrilling viewing, and a nice dose of environmentalist claptrap along the way. And don't forget the awkwardly-placed stock footage. But Richard Norton is charming as ever, and he singlehandedly keeps this movie from being a total flop. Take him out of the equation, and this movie would be unwatchably horrid. We do, however, give it credit for having the ORIGINAL Prometheus (2012).Another name in the cast besides Norton would have helped...Don Swayze, Robert Davi, Matthias Hues, somebody. At least in his previous movie, Surface to Air (1998), director McDonald had Michael Madsen and Chad McQueen. Here, it's just Norton. But the power of Norton keeps the movie afloat. Get it? Afloat? Meh, just don't see it. (Unless you're a really big Norton fan).For more action insanity, drop by: www.comeuppancereviews.com",4
134,Car crash film,"It's awful, difficult to tear your eyes away from.It's like the zit on the end of the nose of the person you are talking to.It has redeeming features, hence the 2 stars I gave.The story line has potential and one or two of the actors make a decent attempt with the dire dialogue.",2
135,Lame sci-fi wasting a great martial artist,"Although I'm a huge fan of Australian martial artist Richard Norton, I feel that this cheap science fiction film hardly showcases him at his best. Instead it's a dead-headed B-movie that copies the best bits of DIE HARD and THE PHILADELPHIA EXPERIMENT, showing how the crew of a futuristic submarine travel back to the present day after an apocalypse, attempting to prevent the course of history through violence.It sounds largely interesting but in terms of execution this isn't. Most of the running time is made up of sub-par action on a ship, but UNDER SIEGE is ten times better than this. The action is frequent but lightweight, and Mr. Norton doesn't even get to show off his superior fighting skills, thanks to the lacklustre direction. The whole thing looks and smells cheap, with lousy acting from the supporting cast and lame dialogue. I'd skip it.",3
136,"Soo bad, you'll laugh!","Actually I could have given this movie a very high rating, given, it makes you laugh a lot, it's so badly done and everything is so fake, you actually laugh at all this. And that might deserve a higher rating.The very story on it's own is clearly the outcome of a combination of wrongly mixed drugs.Various stories run along the main plot. But first things first, the basics: A submarine time-machine that runs on diamonds, travels to the past to stop a drilling rig of inducing a worldwide cataclysm by perforating the mantle and destabilizing the pressure, making everything go kaboom.The movie starts with a diamond theft in the future where apparently all cars are exactly the same as in the 70's. The diamond burglars manage to get away from the police that followed them in an Ice- cream van or something alike, very shabby indeed. I never knew those vans where more powerful than police cars. Anyway, they just reach the beach and enter the sea and keep on swimming until they reach the submarine. This is when the movie starts for real! Well, so they say...The main character is like a fusion of MacGyver and Michael Knight. He is introduced rescuing a kidnapped guy, killing the first batch on the main floor with guns, and later on, on the first floor with a crossbow and a pen as an arrow, apparently because he doesn't want to be heard (surely the mass shooting downstairs went unnoticed to the ears of the kidnappers).The eco-terrorists have clearly no budget and have to assault the rig in a small Zodiak. Apparently they spent it all on the guns. Magic guns BTW that kill before even shooting, as can be seen when they enter the room full of machines with flashing buttons and pseudo-scientists that have been told to move their hands and touch buttons to appear more professional and scientific. Of the Nautilus crew assaulting the rig, I wont talk, that must be seen by itself.Not to forget the overtly sassy footage of a NASA rocket that now is a missile that intercepts F-18's.",1
137,Richard Norton Sci-Fi Action!,"Richard Norton proves again in ""Nautilus"" that he ranks among the top actors in action movies.  He plays a mercenary with a sense of humor, first introduced in the corridors of a seedy South American hotel as he darts the fists and the gunfire of his adversaries.  The scene is played effectively with a contemporary Indiana Jones tone, and it's a swift intro to the more expansive adventure that follows.  Norton's mercenary gets hired to head security on an oceanic rig that tracks a mysterious vessel on its radar.  The vessel is a time-traveling sub that returns to circa 2000 to stop a global environmental collapse and to inform the rig's well-meaning scientist (Hannes Jaenecke) about the dangers of his actions to the future.  ""Nautilus"" is fast-paced, diverting fun, and with an enjoyable ""wink"" to his audience, Norton takes his fans on an a cruise that's consistently a cool ride.  ""Nautilus"" is a must-have DVD for Sci Fi devotees and action fans.",10
138,"Not as bad as 30,000 leagues but very close.","That other terrible submarine film 30,000 Leagues Under the Sea is even worse than this rubbish, hard to believe but it's true. This one had it all, bad script, acting, casting, special effects, fight scenes and the Admiral looked to be at least ten years past retiral age, was no one younger and more plausible available? Only for lovers of very bad films.",2
139,Clip from Barb Wire,"Only watched a few minutes - stopped once I realised they were reusing car chase footage from the 1996 movie Barb Wire. The fact that they resort to that kind of thing so early in the movie, convinced me that it wouldn't be worth watching any more... And yes I do realise what a nerd that makes me for spotting the duplication :)",1

I have lived to the perfect age, long enough to see Kurt Russell protray Santa and he is perhaps the best, most endearing, Santa I have seen in many a moon.

144,The Ending Scenes Will Warm Your Heart,"This was a truely great film, and Netflix outdid themselves.

150,Best Xmas film in years! #Believe,"I was blown away by this film. I don't usually do anything Xmas until December but this caught my eye. I was ready for a run of the mill Xmas movie which I could have on in the background. Kurt Russell was a big reason I gave it a go. Boy was I surprised! The humour was spot on, the story was great, the feels were there. Honestly, I felt like a kid again with that magical heart flutter and excitement at --the prospect of-- being a believer. I did shed a tear or two, and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. But I also had many many giggles. Will definitely watch again. The elves were cute and had great personality, I loved the interaction, and fairytale feel they offered. The reindeer were spot on and so beautifully mastered.This was beautifully written and masterfully brought to life. It had all the elements of a decent, well thought about, family film. The effects were superb and if I had been to the cinema to see it on the big screen, I would not have been disappointed.Well done Netflix, you really excelled with this one. Especially with the casting. It's going to get another watch before Xmas!I have to go now and write my letter to Santa. Merry Christmas! X",10

153,This was simply amazing...,"Now, initially I had some aversion to sitting down and watching ""The Christmas Chronicles"" even though it was readily available on Netflix for me to watch. Why? Well, it is a Christmas movie, and they have an overwhelming tendency to be so sappy that even pine tress go ""no, I ain't touching that sticky thing"", and also because I didn't really think Kurt Russell would be suited for a Christmas movie.My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to watch in on December 24th, you know, just to get into sappy Christmas mood. And let me tell you, I am really happy that I decided to watch ""The Christmas Chronicles"".Why? Well, first of all, this movie was devoid of the usual Christmas sappy storyline where a girl falls in love and have to traverse hardships and always end up in the arms of the man that is out of reach on Christmas morning. This movie was all fun, all excitement and all Yule tide spirits. I actually will go as far as saying that ""The Christmas Chronicles"" actually have potential to become a Christmas classic - one of the type of Christmas movies that you watch year after year, up alongside ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"".""The Christmas Chronicles"" is definitely a family movie, but it is also a movie that you can enjoy without the family around you, because it caters to a wide array of audience. There is something in the movie for everybody.There is actually a great amount of fun, action and thrills throughout the course of the movie, and you don't feel that the movie ever loses its momentum or becomes slowed down and turning dull. I must admit that I was wholeheartedly entertained from start to end.Now, let's venture on to the role of Santa Claus as portrayed by Kurt Russell. I grew up watching him in action movies, so I didn't really want to embrace him in a role such as this. But I was proven so wrong, because he did this so amazingly well. He was really a nice cast for the role, and he brought his own rugged charm and spirit to the Santa character, and I loved that. So my Christmas hat off for Mr. Russell in his performance in ""The Christmas Chronicles"".The singing and dancing scene was something I initially felt weird about, but oh man that quickly caught on and grew on you. And I ended up loving that scene, because it is full of energy, it is a catchy song, and Kurt Russell delivers the song and dance so well.All in all, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is a movie that you owe to yourself and your family to sit down, either alone or together, and watch, because it is definitely a fun and wholehearted Christmas movie.This movie definitely helped put some cheer on my day...",8
154,Great for the whole family. Ignore the Critics. Love Kurt Russell,This movie is so well done. The critics are stupid by not rating this better. It has all the feels you want in a Christmas movie. Kurt Russell does a great job as Santa and the kid actors do a great job as well. Not overly cheesy like some of the Hallmark movies can get. The CGI is pretty good too. The elves are cute. My three girls loved that part. Guys and girls will like it equally. In my top 5 favorite Christmas movies for sure.,10
155,Magical!,"I put this movie at 11 o'clock Thanksgiving night, not intending to watch the whole thing. Here it is 1am and I'm just finishing. Chris Columbus did a great job producing this film! It definitely reminded me of Christmas movies he had worked on in the past like home alone and Christmas with the Kranks. This movie was very childlike and magical. I will say some of the parts of the movie were a bit scary and some were eye roll inducing but other than it's a great film. Kurt Russell does a great job playing Santa and I think the only person who might've played this type of Santa better would be Tim Allen, though they were virtually the same. I think maybe Tim would've liked to play Santa like this if Disney hadn't given him so many limitations...but what do I know? The kids and elves were so cute. As a fellow New Englander I was Happy to see a small Mill town like Lowell, MA represented. I was honestly surprised in both and good and disappointing way that they didn't revive the dad at the end but that would probably be pushing it too far. All and all this is a wonderful Christmas film that will definitely become a Christmas classic as it's like elf, home alone and the Santa clause in one film.",10
156,Best Christmas (Santa) Movie Since Santa Clause,I wasn't sure about this but was curious from the trailer. I have to say I think this was one of the best I have seen in quite a while now. It definitely beats anything at the theaters and we were able to enjoy it in our home. I am thankful for Netflix putting together such a wonderful movie.,10
157,A Must See!,"This is truly an enchanted updated look at Santa Clause! It's sweet without getting saccharine, and has fun and interesting turns around every corner! The whole family will really enjoy every moment! :-)",10
158,solid heart,"Teddy has been naughty ever since the death of his father. His younger sister Kate is still a true believer in Santa Claus. When she discovers video evidence of Santa, she forces Teddy to help her film him on his gift giving tour. They do manage to capture Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on video and stowaway on his sleight. That's when their adventure begins.Kurt Russell delivers his version of an irreverent Santa Claus. I do like him and I do like the kids. There is real heart when heart is called for. The elves are a little weird. They would be better as more cuddly. The big misstep are the criminals and Teddy stealing a car. It's a little too dark. The bad guys have no reason to kidnap the kid anyways. I buy them stealing the bag but kidnapping is an unnecessary step too far. They should just punch his lights out and walk away with the bag. They can still do a lot of the same stuff except Teddy would be searching the streets for the bag. I like for some of the darker aspects to be pulled back like throwing the bag into the furnace. This is a nice light sentimental Christmas story.",7
159,Watch out Christmas! There's a new Seasonal Masterpiece,"Disney, Hallmark, Pixar. These are the companies that you think of when searching for a feel-good, seasonal, movie. Well there's a new player in town! Netflix knocks it out the park with ""The Christmas Chronicles"". A star-studded cast, an engaging epoch, and artful animation and special effects skyrocket this flick to the top.This story with it's funny and heartwarming tale rivals the Christmas greats. ""The Christmas Chronicles"" brings to mind few comparable motion pictures. Only the likes of ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""White Christmas"", or ""Elf"" (and a few others) can invoke such laughs, smiles, and tears as ""The Christmas Chronicles"".",9
160,A FEEL GOOD Christmas classic film Both inspirational and heart warming. Best Christmas present ever!!,"Kurt Russell who plays the modern day real life Santa Claus (who doesn't do ""Ho Ho Ho"") will be another annual film Christmas Classic along side (1946) It's A Wonderful Life with Jimmy Stewart, (1947) Miracle on 34th Street with Edmund Gwenn, and (1951) A Christmas Carol (aka Scrooge) with Alastair Sim. It brought back that Christmas""y"" warm fuzzy feeling in the belly of Mrs. Shullivan and I, and tears welled up as well.The two kids who purposely hitch a ride in Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve while Santa is in the midst of delivering the world's presents initially cause Santa and his reindeer havoc and a slight delay for Santa. But of course all is well in the world with this marvelous inspirational Christmas classic film when the two children join forces with Santa and help him make it through the night, making all the children and adults in the world dreams come true. Ohhhh, and it just warms your heart and stirs your innermost emotion which every great Christmas film classic is intended to deliver. The Christmas Chronicles delivers with every scene and rocking and rolling song from the films beginning to the happy conclusion.A great FEEL GOOD Christmas film classic that will stand up well to the test of time for both young and old movie fans alike.",8
161,Now that was a very good Christmas flick!,"I saw the trailer for this before it came out and when I found out that one of the producers who directed Home Alone and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was doing this film, I became interested and watched this Netflix film today.To my surprise, it was much better than I expected. Yes I wish it could've been two hours longer, but there are lots of things to like.The atmosphere, the production values that suited the imaginative moments really well, the visual effects, the music, and the humor. Also, the entire cast did a fine job.The actors who played Kate and Teddy Pierce, the two children protagonists of the film, weren't that bad, but Kurt Russell made this film for me. He managed to bring energy, humor, and mythos to his role as Santa Claus and becomes the very heart of the film.I understand the mixed reviews the film just got, but I'm totally recommending this to others who love Santa Claus! Yes it's far from being a masterpiece but as far as modern holiday films go, this is one of the best!",9
162,Easy to watch family holiday movie,"We watched this as we let out thanksgiving meal settle. It was the perfect choice for the kids (age range 5-12) and the parents. The acting was fine and the jokes were funny. I even got a little choked up at times when they talked about their recently deceased dad. All in all, a fine film. Probably not an instant classic, but good enough to watch and not feel like I wasted 1.5 hours of my life. I loved the new interpretation of elves as almost gremlin-like creatures.",8
163,A Warm Christmas Movie That Touches the Heaer! A Must See!,Loved this movie loads of laughs and special effects! Great family movie! We all enjoyed it on Thanksgiving Day!!!,10
164,My favourite Christmas Movie ever,"This movie really is great. Kurt Russell as Santa is excellent, the best. The cast is great, acting and effects are amazing. The elves are so funny and cute, the elves really make this film with their cuteness and humour.All of the special effects are really good, it really is my all time favourite Christmas film. A heart warming story of a family torn apart by loss, being brought back together through Christmas love and belief.Watch this with your family and friends this Christmas, you won't be disappointed I promise. Even my partner liked this film and he's not big on Christmas.Ho ho ho and Merry Christmas!!!!",10
165,Surprisingly Entertaining!,"Due to the low IMDB score, I almost didn't watch this. However, a free download plus pandemic desperation forced my hand, and I'm glad it did.
The current ""storyline"" on the IMDB page doesn't really reflect what this movie is all about. It's actually an action-comedy, but intelligent & subtle comedy. OK, not a comedy at all, but a really funny drama. Or something. Hard to pigeonhole it. Anyway, it's basically a rollercoaster of a ride, with constant action, and intelligent script, tight editing, and excellent acting. (The entire cast is perfect.) Usually when an unknown director is also the main actor, the movie stinks, but Ryan Churchill is one of the rare exceptions. I think he has a huge future ahead of him.
And I have no connection to this film, look at my other reviews. I was tempted to give it a ""10"" just to raise the absurdly-low average score, but ""*8"" is a fair & accurate rating. I'm telling you, just give this flick a chance.",8
166,What was THAT??? NOT sorry.,"I wasn't expecting this to be as funny as it was. My advice - if it's funny, just LAUGH, and don't try to understand it 100 percent. It's a fast, easy watch, and time well spent.",10
167,A Nutshell Review: Fame,"I had watched the original Fame movie when I was a kid, enough to know the theme song sung by Irene Cara, but little else. Fast forward to today, I'm pretty sure I still enjoyed the reworked theme song, but the film unfortunately is a disaster, with predictable story lines, cardboard characters, and while I'm quite OK that it may have tried to be more documentary like in its presentation, it just fell short on almost all accounts, save for some of the set musical pieces.Despite its hip trailer aimed specifically at its demographic audience, the film just didn't work out, and tried too hard to resemble plenty of dance movies already out there, except that it did a lot more worse by injecting too many characters having everyone bear the brunt of the burden in carrying the film through its runtime, through supporting role appearances at best. Having cast a relative bunch of good looking unknowns also helped in providing the fresh-facedness required, but it's akin to watching a bad episode of American Idol, except that you don't get to choose who stays and who goes.Granted it wanted to be more ""School like"" encompassing all the various subjects taught from dance to acting, in quite an elitist fashion in getting mere hundreds amongst thousands of applicants, and if quality control was so stringent, it provided critical flaws to the plausibility of the show. For one, these characters are talented folks, and it's just no good treating talented folks like toddlers in school, picking on every little thing they do wrong in hoping to polish those rough diamonds. Also, the screening of candidates, while provided some Audition hilarity, was mostly based on the whims of the various instructors, hence the kind of petty issues they dredge up for themselves, like the angry actor who thought the stage was his calling, throwing tantrums and in need for some serious counselling.But the most critical flaw of them all, for a movie in its genre, is whence the buildup and character development? We're suppose to believe that after their graduation they're all ""ready to make it"" in the big, bad, unforgiving world of fine art performance. Unfortunately the output's pretty much the same as the input, save for a few characters who turned into perfect gems overnight, with nary any focus on their transformation. The best just coasted through school, while the worst (amongst the best) turned in much better performances through the sprinkle of magic dust or through the rubbing of shoulders. There must be something in the diet served by the school's canteen as well it seems.Fame fell short and became plain, formula, predictable, and ultimately boring. The screenplay reeked laziness - who needs yet another teenage movie where it tells you that even the best amongst us suffer from trouble dished out by disapproving parents, romantic relationship roadblocks, yet another naive girl becoming bait for hot looking predatory guys, wanting to fulfill a deep desire and break out of routine, discrimination, trust and integrity. The list just goes on, no thanks to individual cardboard characters being assigned some thematic homework, and turning in the results in little episodes and scenes, without allowing the audience to build any emotional connection, or to even root for the underdogs.It's ambitious too in its setting, taking on the entire school journey of these select group of youngsters, albeit without a real story, nor gelling them together in one coherent way. Technically, director Kevin Tancharoen (who had so far done music videos) and cinematographer Scott Kevan had opted for the shaky cam technique, for what reasons I do not fathom, and came off quite irritatingly. Someone should start preaching the virtues of mounting the camera of a tripod, versus making it a lame excuse to want to do it documentary style, or to allow for fluid motion in capturing the performances, not!The only saving grace here, are some of the performances, be it group dance ensembles, or solo acts. I had preferred the former a lot more for their energy and choreography, and amongst all the disciplines, I personally enjoyed the dances a lot more, compared to the others like acting, or even singing, due to the rather lacklustre tunes and mediocre lyrics.This is one film that I'd rather not remember its name, and could be called anything else other than a remake of Fame.",2
168,Go in expecting a collection of enthralling dance numbers and you will be walking out a satisfied customer,"Kevin Tancharoen's rambunctious first feature film (after directing a series of music TV shows like ""The Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll"") isn't as mawkish or amateur as you may expect. He may not have Martin Scorsese or Steven Spielberg looking over their shoulders, but Tancharoen clearly knows how to shoot a dance sequence. Thankfully he understands what the audience want from a movie like this and it isn't lengthy conversations or scenes to showcase the young stars' acting chops, we want exceptional dancing mixed with an ear-pleasing soundtrack. From that standpoint this first-timer delivers.We meet the characters during the introduction as they audition for a spot in the highly sought-after academy, each one of them showing their obvious skills over a well crafted montage that establishes the tone for the rest of the movie. From there we go from one rhythmic set piece to another, of varying enjoyment levels, with the absolute highlight coming from a Halloween party boogie at the halfway point. The gigantic finale goes for broke however doesn't quite reach the heights it should. Also worth noting is Tancharoen's ability to ensure non-dance enthusiasts (like myself) will be entertained no matter what art form is on display; those who think they could never take pleasure in ballet just try and not be entranced with the routine led by the lithe Kherington Payne in the second half.Every film needs a plot and character arcs mind you and this is where Fame's failings become quite evident. The massive ensemble cast is simply too big; trying to follow the amount of individuals on offer is often frustrating. When you start to like someone they disappear for 30 minutes whilst we see the other dozen or so stories unfold, and only randomly do they intersect each other. Of the young cast Kay Panabaker, Asher Brook and Paul Iacono are the pick whilst the wise and wonderful teachers are best served by Bebe Neuwirth and Charles S. Dutton.So how much is the final result affected by the hit-and-miss acting (the romantic scenes between the teens are excruciating), unfocused screenplay and ridiculous reasons to break out in song and dance? Not all that much to be honest. A film that can be this fun to watch doesn't deserve to be hung up on faulting elements such as these. Go in expecting a collection of enthralling dance numbers and you will be walking out a satisfied customer.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6
169,Fame - An Unfortunate Snoozer,"I remember when I was younger I enjoyed the original Fame movie. Although I currently can't remember anything about the movie at all, save for the theme song. Tonight I got the chance to see the sneak peek of the 2009 version. Overall, I wasn't impressed. What was wrong with the movie? 1.) The plotor lack thereof. There were so many ""main"" characters, that the scenes just jumped from one to another without any real cohesion. Sometimes there were even two scenes going on at the same time with the camera flashing back and forth between the two.2.) The timeline. Before each ""section"" of the movie, you got a title like ""Freshman Year"", ""Sophomore Year"", ""Junior Year"", and ""Senior Year"". This would have been fine if they spent any time in these years. Instead, they went by so fast that the title just threw off the pace. For example, you get introduced to the characters and see ""Freshman Year"". Then you get to see their insecurities and character flaws all over the course of one day. The next day is ""Sophomore Year"" and the characters have made no forward progress since day one of freshman year. The movie could have been vastly improved by simply stripping out these time stamps.3.) Character development. Tied to the first two problems with this movie is the character development. There is so much going on and time passes so fast that you don't really get to see much development of many of the characters. I understand there is only so much time in the movie, but that could have been resolved by reducing the number of ""lead"" characters. If you reduced the number of people we had to keep track of, we'd be able to see more how those characters evolve, and care more about them in the end.4.) Lack of resolution. None of these characters really show any sign of improvement until the last scene in the movie, and then we still get no resolution on how things turned out. The last scene is graduation and we have no idea if any of these people amounted to anything after that. Very few even make mention to what they MIGHT be doing after the movie ends. Heck, I would have even settled for the lame freeze frame with written text explaining what people went on to do (which is a pretty cheesy cheat out of writing a resolution to your story as is).5.) Predictability and memorable characters/scenes. I am going to lump these two issues together, because they go pretty much hand-in-hand. the movie from beginning to end was pretty predictable. There were absolutely zero surprises within. As a result, there was very little memorable about the movie. In fact, without looking at IMDb, I couldn't name a single character in the movie.So was there anything good about the movie? I guess for what it was, it was an okay movie. No real surprises, and nothing you are going to remember any length of time from now (which is maybe why I don't remember the first movie). But I did enjoy the gratuitous completely unrealistic cafeteria jam session on day one of Freshman Year. And some of the cast music (which I assume was mostly originalat least nothing I've heard elsewhere) was good. Actually, I would have been okay if it was just one jam session after another, because I kinda dug that cheesy scene. Otherwise I say that if you are really interested in this movie, or perhaps a fan of the previous one, wait for the DVD. There are much better movies you could spend your money watching, especially since tickets are so high these days.",3
170,They should officially change the name to LAME.,"okay.... so first things first.... I was invited to the N.Z. premiere tonight in Auckland of the new ""Fame"" reboot or remake or whatever you want to call it. I thought free food, a few celebrities to stalk and some free beers and then the movie to end it all, sounds like a good night. I grew up with the 80's fame on t.v. I saw Leroy rocking it weekly on screen... so yeah I was interested to see how they re-branded this film for the new millennium. To be frank, I was not expecting ""Fame"" to be an academy award masterpiece but I was still very intrigued after watching the trailer, the music sounded cool, the atmosphere seemed a little charged the trailer was cut nicely... but sadly... thats where all the excitement ended in the trailer.....This movie is b- to- the -oring.!! BORING! So I will be mentioning some spoilers so stop reading here if that's an issue for you.... got an issue grab a tissue.Basically they take a bunch of very talented up and coming singers, dancers, actors etc and they cram 4 freaking years of this elusive, over the top, hardest school in the world to get accepted to into a roughly 90 minute film. Every 25 minutes was one year.. starting with a ""freshman year"" title on the screen... then about 25 minutes later fade to black and ""sophomore year"" then about 25 minutes later ""junior"" etc etc... this spread the movie extremely thin... although the leads hair grew longer or haircuts changed so you knew they were older and more mature.They have the cliché young black guy who is full of torment and angst that his father left him, who sits all melancholy in the stairwell while everyone else is in the cafeteria dancing on tables and plugging in guitars and hitting bongos. There is the young black woman who is being forced to play classical piano by her parents when all she really wants to do is be free and sing her heart out... because no one cares about her needs. There is the typical geeky video guy who always seems to have a camera in his hands when you see him, the gay male ballet dancer who no matter how hard he tries cannot cut it and impress his teacher.... blah blah blah and the young girl actress wannabe singer who starts singing in a little tiny voice all shy and quiet, so you would expect that bam she will find herself and come out of her shell like her teachers have been telling her the ENTIRE 4 YEARS!!!!! BUT NO.... nothing changes... she doesn't get a big voice, stays wooden and timid and shy... I mean seriously I thought this school was supposed to be only accepting the best of the best! They just spent the first 20 minutes showing us auditions and having the school principal tell everyone that thousands audition but only a few hundred are accepted!! There are so many cheesy moments, from the black guy saying ""aiightt"" to the ""I just want my parents to be proud of me"" to the boyfriend ""I'm just going to sing to you and give you a big hug and then cartoon rabbits will come out and doves will lower a silk scarf around your neck and there will be world peace and God bless you tiny tim""... what?!?! Okay so maybe I'm going a little over board but there was more cheese in this then a stuffed crust pizza from domino's.I think the biggest problem with this film is you walk away with a ""who cares"" mindset. The fact that they have approx. 10 main roles and follow them for their four years of tuition which is crammed into 90 minutes of movie is so thin... you just don't care about the characters at all because you don't get to know them. Each person maybe gets about 15-20 minutes screen time max. Then you are left wondering so what about him or what about her or did she make the album or did he get kicked out or did they stay together or how did the father handle the news????!? The story is not interesting, it extremely average, there is ZERO edge to this reboot.... no pizazz no hype no excitement. It's plain dull.I'm sure that young girls aged between 5-13 will like this, is this who 'fame' is catered towards??? I mean if tweens is the fame target demographic then it may do okay for a week or two. Sadly the biggest audience reaction from tonight's ""Fame"" premiere was when the ""New Moon"" trailer screened before the start.Some good things..... The singing is amazing... the dancing is as you would expect incredible but over all that's it. The acting a big thumbs down, I came away from this feeling like it was a very expensive made for TV movie. The story is all over the place, spread top thin and unlike the trailer again I say there is no edge, It's like a pilot for a new TV series... actually.... is that what it is suppose to be?!?FAME is LAME!",2
171,"Baby, Remember My Name","The 1980 original, ""Fame"", was a gritty depiction of life at a public performing arts high school in New York City. The 2009 remake, ""Fame"", is a puff piece, never daring to handle any of the intense (yet still relevant) subject matter that was handled so eloquently by its predecessor. Rather than abortion and sexual assault, it focuses on stuff like troubled teen love and disapproving parents. Staying well within the parameters of its PG-rating (the original was rated R), it lacks the edginess and aforementioned grittiness that defined the film it emulates and, instead, closely resembles something that Disney might have produced as a vehicle for the likes of Miley Cyrus or the Jonas Brothers. Fortunately, I like Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers...and, all flaws aside, I surprisingly enjoyed ""Fame"". It is not the important and relevant film than it probably wants to be, but it is a fun, well-made, and nicely-acted display of its young stars' undeniable talent.Read My Full Review Exclusively At: www.thecinemaview.blogspot.com",6
172,"OK, but not spectacular.","I really enjoyed seeing how talented they were, and it gets you feeling rhythmic. At first, I thought it was going to be a good movie, seeing how the auditions went. But, after that part and they went onto freshman year, I got a little disappointed. They showed the students' problems, and what they're going through to make it to be famous, but it almost seems like the director got bored of the movie itself, and just skipped through a lot in the movie. You don't see how the students' problems were faced and how they were solved, you first see them upset, and then at the end, they're happy and ready to graduate? That's not a very good plot, actually, there isn't a plot at all. I am upset with the movie, but the dancing was great. Overall, it really was enjoyable.",6
173,"In the light of Art school films, just more development!","If you're thinking this is just another Step-Up, Save the Last Dance, or Raise Your Voice, you're wrong, but there are definite similarities. This features a school for the arts, much like the other film, but this one goes through a bit more character development.Everyone has to audition to see if they have what it takes to get into the school. Starring Megan Mullally, Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles Dutton, and other stars that aren't really well known to me. The bigger names are all teachers who help the students with their musical and acting talent. This movie gets into what families struggle through to get their kids into a really good school. Including making hard decisions and in the end letting them make their own choices. Relationships are tested and if you really care about someone, you will not let anything get in the way. This movie may seem dull at first, but it was a good one to watch and might just be more exciting than the others I have mentioned.",8
174,"A Remake of a Classic 80's film,that falls flat quick.","There is a general consensus that remakes are in trouble. The remake of ""Fame"" even though it masquerades as a reinvention,is no exception. The last time ""Fame"" was in theatres was in back in 1980. With the direction of Alan Parker,and at the time an unknown cast,this was indeed a preppy tale trailing a bunch if gifted kids at the prestigious New York performing arts high school had some electrifying energy as well as some incredible musical numbers and some pizzaz. The movie also introduce some newcomers at the time including the theatrical debut of a teenage looking Irene Cara. That was back in 1980. What was once fresh and innovative and newly created then is now tired and dull,not to mention a lack of interest. And it shows in this new version,which was hyped up during its theatrical trailer is hopeless and completely pathetic. Basically the film follows the same exact formula.You have thousands of teenagers that are united by the same dream: attending the New York High School of the Performing Arts. Over Ten-Thousand auditions,200 places-which was a very selected school where only one in a chance are accepted where survival is the fittest to succeed. In this version,every student thinks that he or she has a special talent and from there the culture reeks with everyone's sweaty desire to accomplished the impossible goal......the desire for fame. The style of this film opens like an American Idol-esquire opening with the scene proves otherwise. Other flaws are abound in this movie and it shows in this remake in which my opinion should haven't been tampered with or remade in the first place. First,there are flaws that are cringe-worthy attempts to take some of the material out of its original context. Unsure whether it wants to be a ""mock"" documentary,or just drop trou and be a musical,this film falters on both counts. The only time the screen jolts awake are moments when the director Kevin Tancharoen finally and actually lets someone perform. The film does have some real talent. Naturi Naughton excels as an aspiring singer and Kherington Payne shows some innovative and unbelievable moves to music of some of today's hottest pop and R&B talents. But the rest of it really falls flat. And some of the cast members that includes Broadway and Tony-award winner Bebe Neuwirth, along with Megan Mullally, Kelsey Grammar, Charles S. Dutton, and Debbie Allen cannot save this picture. Not even the cameo appearance by Irene Cara(who was in the original film along with Debbie Allen)wasn't even the risk. All the singing and dancing can't skew the fact that none of the unknowns cannot act a lick, a fact that which ruins the point of doing a classic 1980's flick like this in the first place. The fact that this film needed actors and a narrative that could have save this picture because the dancers and singers are just brilliant,and it could have save this picture from falling forward. By the way,where are the gay people here? The ones that aren't ready to commit suicide? Who remembers Leroy?",3
175,Screenwriter Bit Off More than he/she could Chew,"Definitely, a niche movie that only relates to teens already in the performing arts. To me it felt like the writer crammed 4 seasons of Degrassi or all 3 High School Musicals into 140 minutes. All in all, there wasn't a sufficient amount of time to flesh out any aspect of the movie. Way too many characters. Dull musical numbers. Bland choreography. Uninteresting AND unnecessary romantic subplots.The movie should have focused more on the professional growth of each student over the course of freshman year by really spotlighting the student/teacher dynamic. Instead the movie flaunts the futile personal endeavors of each student over a four year span at a prestigious academy. So by the end, the high school backdrop felt completely pointless because the students learned absolutely nothing to separate their senior level experience from the original insecurity of their auditions.",2
176,"""FAME"" – REMEMBER their Names (& Don't be afraid to SUCCEED)!","(Based on an advance screening).This is a remake of the 1980 film by the same name, about attending the specialized New York Academy of Performing Arts. It uses a large cast to follow the trials & tribulations of students, their interactions with each other, their parents, the staff & the (very) ""outside"" world around them.Jenny (KAY PANABAKER) is an initially ""mousy"" type of actress-singer, with little confidence or understanding in what she does and the motivations of some people around her. She's encouraged (& later romanced) by self-assured & generous-spirited MARCO (ASHER BOOK) who'd sung for years in his father's restaurant (& has a good & pleasant-sounding voice, such as in performing ""Someone To Watch Over Me"" & ""I Just Got To Be Happy""). Denise (NATURI NAUGHTON) is a talented classical pianist, altho she dislikes doing just that & being forced to do so by her pushy father.Kevin (PAUL McGILL), who has a dance-teacher mother back in Iowa, wants to be a dancer-- tho the instructor isn't very encouraging about his talent. Malik (COLLINS PENNIE) wants to be an actor, but, his teacher (CHARLES S. DUTTON) points out he comes across as overly angry.Outgoing comedic Neil (PAUL IOCONO) loves doing video work all over the place, & carelessly urges his dad to put up money to produce a movie. Walter (VICTOR TAVERAS) likes to produce & arrange music. Alice (KHERINGTON PAYNE) is an accomplished dancer who eagerly wants a career in that field (rather than concentrating on romance in her life). Joy (ANNA MARIA PEREZ DE TAGLE) is a dedicated student.Various segments feature some of the older, well-known stars: MEGAN MULALLY (as singing teacher Fran who's urged to perform by some of the kids at one point); KELSEY Grammar (in an understated performance as acting instructor Joel); BEBE NEUWIRTH as teacher Lynn; and, as Principal Simms, you have DEBBIE ALLEN (who played 'Lydia Grant' in the ORIGINAL 1980 version of the film, plus the same role in 131 episodes of the TV show rendition from 1982-1987).The film has a wonderful ENERGY in many of its musical and dance numbers (such as 'Out Here On My Own' and 'CarnEvil', and the large closing one with drums). Some performances are so impressive in the film (such as ones by Naturi), they got APPLAUSE from people in the movie theater audience. I liked the way they individually 'PRESENTED - INTRODUCED' the main actors separately during the credit section at the end (as movies ""used"" to do).But, by sort of hurrying through what they say is a ""4-year"" period at the school, certain elements of the DRAMA are periodically ""RUSHED"" and a bit weak compared to the musical & dance elements. As a friend commented, he felt the film showed little real ""growth"" by the performers thru the period featured, & thus came across as somewhat ""cliched"". While I feel there's some accuracy in that position (in that the drama sections are a trifle ""feeble"" by comparison), I felt that the MUSICAL & DANCE elements & overall acting are so strong (& the main ""point"" of the film), they MAKE UP for that in providing a very EFFECTIVE entertainment vehicle (& a bunch of the young actor / performers are people to ""WATCH"" & REMEMBER for the future!).",8
177,Fame seems pretty awful,"Don't be fooled by the trailers, Fame is not as dazzling and inspiring as it may seem. Strip away the fancy lighting, music and camera work and you're left with nothing less than a cast of one dimensional, mundane, and unlikeable characters. The movie doesn't give enough time for any of the characters to develop and therefore, I ended up feeling like I barely knew the characters at all, even at the end of the film. I don't even think I could name all of them. The actual script and dialogue is not any better and the plot feels forced and irrelevant to what the movie claims to be about. From the looks of it, no one in the movie is cut out for actual ""fame"" with the exception of Payne's character who is portrayed as an arrogant and selfish dancer. The cast had a lot of potential to become very likable characters but because of the poor script, their performances fall flat and feel fake. I entered the movie with hopes of being entertained even if it was on a strictly ""crowd pleaser"" level. I left feeling like I had just wasted an hour and a half of my life learning that ""success is love."" There are no real resolutions to any of the character's trials and tribulations. Life must suck at this performing arts school because no one learns anything particularly profound or life changing. Don't waste your time with this movie, and if you still want to, at least wait for it to come out on DVD. The large screen, dark theater, and popcorn won't make this movie any better than the dud that it is.",2
178,Fame; It Wont Last Forever,"""What was the point of making this movie?"" I continually asked myself this question during the 107 minutes after the previews were over. There were 10 main characters, none of which have enough screen time (not that their acting talent merited more) to make you care about them. It is so filled with old teen and musical movie clichés that the plot can be predicted by the time the ""freshman"" sequence is over. Fame is about the New York City High School of Performing Arts and 200 students who spend four years of their lives going there. That is the plot and then there are all the different characters whose stories are so stereotypical that they have all been told in another movie at some point. There is the under-privileged, talented, black boy from the ghetto who falls for the girl who's a piano virtuoso but really just wants to sing, but her father won't let her, the uptight white girl who finds a guy who helps her loosen up, the director who gets scammed out of $5000, the guy who isn't talented enough to make it and tries to kill himself, and so many more. The characters are all completely one dimensional except for the teachers, who have some substance but not enough screen time to make you care about them more than you care about the students. The writing is very limited and the direction is no better than most of the other dance movies to have some out in the past five years. The choreography wasn't bad but you can find much better in other films (i.e Take the Lead). The high points of this film are the cinematography and the film editing which were very good, but you forget about the look of the shots after all the mindless droning of the characters. The only suggestion I could give to the producer's would be to take the cast of the faculty (which included Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth and Megan Mullay of 90's sitcom fame) and some of Sinclair's dancers, actors, and singers to launch a TV show. That would at least have some talent and would be worth spending the hour a week to watch.",2
179,Lame is the word,"While the 1980 film was not a masterpiece, with an abrupt ending, some rambling dialogue and an imbalance of development of characters, it was entertaining with great songs, spirited choreography, good performances and a story with themes that were relevant then and also are now. The 2009 Fame can be seen as a make-over and sadly it is not a good one. Kelsey Grammar and Charles S. Dutton give decent performances, the singing is quite good and tuneful and better than the material deserves and the finale is fun, but that's pretty much it. The film feels too much like a High School Musical film or something lifted from the Disney channel, which means dull lighting, sets with a overly-studio-bound look and at times awkward editing that looks like a bad music promo. Much preferred the soft-grained, grittier look of the 1980 film. The songs are not very memorable and nowhere near the standard of those from the 1980 film, which had three truly great songs while this film had no good original one and felt like various music commercials/promos cobbled together. Someone to Watch Over Me and the pre-existing classical music are fine but this criticism is more aimed for the songs written for the film. The script is all fluff and no depth, all gloss and no heart and is very shallow and scattershot structurally. The plot was little more than a throw-away in a painfully predictable way and little effort is made to show the grit and the atmosphere of being at a performing arts school that the 1980 film did brilliantly. The pacing was odd because the film did often feel too short and rushed but at the same time because of the vapidity and the stale feel of it all it was dull as well. The characters are mismatched and the film doesn't give anywhere near enough time to develop them or allow us to root for them, they're just cookie-cutter cut-outs ranging from bland to irritating. In fact the personalities are so flat they border on inter-changeable and without any distinction, maybe if there weren't as many and that the film was longer and this problem would have been halfway solved. The choreography is sometimes spirited but often lacks heart and originality, like with that Hot Lunch Jam re-creation which fell completely flat. Apart from Grammar and Dutton, the acting doesn't cut it, Megan Mullally looked medicated, Bebe Neuwirth has done a lot of stuff I've liked but she's over-bearing here and the younger cast's inexperience comes through loud and clear. To conclude, a rather lame make-over unfortunately but not without its moments. 3/10 Bethany Cox",3
180,"See the real ""FAME"" movie.","Man, watching this tripe filled remake of the vastly superior 1980 version of ""Fame"" made me want to just abandon this disaster and break out the older flick. To be fair, at least they didn't just rip off the old characters and story lines and transplant them over. On the hand, considering what we are left with here, maybe they should have. Despite the acting caliber of Grammar,Newerth, and Dutton, it still suffers from a bad TV movie script. Were is the gritty realism of the 1980 film? I know they wanted to keep this version a PG, but that just destroyed all the things that made the original work. This lame, tame, tepid remake just makes you walk away with a curse on your lips. What a lousy film.",2
181,"""People will see me and cry""","This remake was doomed from the start. The original film is iconic- even those who haven't seen the film know the theme tune. How can you compete with Irene Cara's original version? The r'n'b remix that this new film uses is terrible. But it's not just the title song that this remake has to compete with. The remake cannot free itself from the shadow of the original.Remaking Fame was not an entirely ridiculous idea. The original was thirty years ago and with the advent of Facebook, YouTube, and all those X-factor type shows, shortcutting your way to fame seems like a real possibility. And the cast actually look like they could be at high school, instead of the original cast that looked like they could have children who were at high school. There was a lot of potential for the director and writer to make a film that didn't try to compete with the original, but was an alternative that could be equally enjoyable.This film focuses more on dance and music than it does acting (perhaps because the actors can't really act). We get the same types of characters that we got for the original, however in the original these characters didn't come off as stereotypes. They were fleshed out and I was gripped by their problems, which were far darker than this film. As a viewer you actually wanted to make an effort to follow all these different characters in the original. However in this film the characters are so cardboard and the situations so clichéd that it's easy to forget who they are. It makes the lyric in the title song: ""baby, remember my name"", amusingly ironic. For the time that the characters are on screen, most of them are annoying. The naive/stupid 'plain' girl and her wet boy-band reject love interest are particular standouts in that department.As in the original, the film marks each year of the characters' time at the school, starting from auditions to graduation, however the time gaps seem to be massive. Random characters and relationships will just come out of nowhere, and so the characters never really progress. Instead it's like amnesia occurs at the end of each year.You can tell which of the songs are from the original film because the other ones are so bland. There is a nice version of Out Here on My Own, although it doesn't compare with Irene Cara's version either in the musical or dramatic sense. Cara's character (Coco) was the showoff star who was actually more vulnerable than she appeared to be. In the new version, she's a bit of a loner- the equivalent of Bruno in the original.But what about those who haven't seen the original? You'll probably be even more lost than the ones who've seen the original and know what to expect. Because the film is character-driven, the lack of interesting characters will make the film seem infinitely long. It attempts to be gritty by adding in a few swear words and 'serious' issues but this just makes it worse. If it was really cheesy at least it might have been entertaining.In short, this film has nothing to say about fame, current or otherwise.",1
182,Fame: A Name That I Will Definitely Remember!,"When I first heard that a remake of ""Fame"" was coming out, I was so excited. But I also was a little bit skeptical. A classic like ""Fame?"" And then the negative reviews started piling up. People, you are all being very unfair. ""Fame"" is the best movie musical since ""Hairspray.""The story: A group of ambitious teens make their way into New York's High School for Performing Arts. There's Denise, Malik, Marco, Victor, Neil, Jenny, Kevin, Joy, Rose, and Alice. They all have one mission: to claim their fame and be successful. But they will have to meet all of the obstacles in order to make it big. Some will claim their fame and others won't.This ""Fame"" has its characters that sort of follow the formula of teen dramas, but so did the original. The students of P.A. are characters that make you feel all of the things they are going through. The 1980's original had that, and so does this version.The reason I love the 2009 edition of ""Fame"" is because I didn't compare it to the original. The original film had a gritty feeling that really affected you. The 2009 version creates a very entertaining and more light take on success and its obstacles. The original movie was rated R, so now we come to a brand-new PG-rated edition. But this one is not to be confused with the dreadfully annoying ""High School Musical"" movies.The acting in this movie is really good. Kelsey Grammar, Bebe Neuwirth, Charles S. Dutton and Megan Mullaly actually make better teachers than the original ones, despite the very good performance of Anne Meara. Along with the adults is the ""Fame"" alumni Debbie Allen in a cameo as the school principal. The movie opens with her classic ""You got big dreams, you want fame"" speech. The students are definitely memorable people. My favorite of them all is Naturi Naughton as Denise. Naughton is the next Jennifer Hudson, believe me. This girl can really belt out solos, especially in the iconic ""Out Here On My Own"" and the grand finale ""Hold Your Dream."" She has had a remarkable musical career, including playing Lil Inez on Broadway in ""Hairspray"" and donning the role of hip-hop star Lil Kim in last year's ""Notorious."" And I would love to see her do more musical roles. Other students like Collins Pennie as Malik, Asher Book as Marco, ""So You Think You Can Dance"" contestant Kherington Payne as Alice, and Kay Panabaker as Jenny really can act and sing too. The cast is gigantic, and they all do a very good job.The music is also a big part of the movie. Without great music to back it up, ""Fame"" would be nothing. Luckily, Mark Isham has created a flawless new score with brand-new songs that the original movie didn't have. And the new ""Fame"" cover is addicting, like the original song. The finale, ""Hold Your Dream,"" is probably my favorite number in the movie. Consider the new ""Fame"" score booked on my Ipod.First time movie director Kevin Tancharaeon, who directed a concert tour for Britney Spears, films the musical numbers with a great documentary-style feel to them. I was very impressed with his work. Right on, Kevin! Wonderful choreography, fantastic music and singing, great acting, and a very good story abound in this new classic. I came out of this movie still singing the songs in my head. I could see Naturi Naughton performing ""Out Here On My Own"" or ""Fame"" on the Oscars. Hopefully, she'll get at least a nomination. This movie is only for fans of the 1980 version that go in knowing what they're in for. Avoid all the terribly underrated reviews. ""Fame"" is better than the ""Step Up"" style crap that has been coming out lately, bar none. As the theme song suggests, I will definitely remember its name.",10
183,Fresh New Faces; Same Old Lessons,"My first impression of the movie was that ""Wow! They've kept the same feel of chaotic creative energy as the original movie."" As I watched, I kept looking for Coco and Bruno and Angelo and Shorofsky and all the other people I remember from the original. When I finally stopped doing that, I was able to focus on what they were doing with the new cast of characters. I saw minor elements and situations from the original, but these played out differently based on the character. The students themselves were fresh and new, with a wonderful modern take. The teachers had the same real-life lessons for the students - a nice touch of consistency. The one negative I noted is that the students this time did not seem to have the same level of character development as in the previous version. These students do not stick in my mind as strongly as the original cast. All-in-all, I would call this a great sequel rather than a remake.",9
184,no originality and cleaned-up G-version,"Various students audition and eventually complete the four years in the High School of Music & Art in NYC. Principal Angela Simms (Debbie Allen) leads a faculty that includes drama teacher Mr. Dowd (Charles S. Dutton), dance teacher Ms. Kraft (Bebe Neuwirth), singing teacher Ms. Rowan (Megan Mullally) and music teacher Mr. Cranston (Kelsey Grammar).The movie simply has too many people and tries to go through too much time. The original has the advantage of being original. Instead of diving into one or two of these characters, the feel is scattered and the four year span doesn't help. It's the same structure as the original but once again, the original was original back then. There is also a cleaning up of the original in this G-rated version. So it's not even as good or edgy as the original and lots of these Step Up Dance Up movies have been made since then. None of this is memorable.",3
185,Full of Excitement with big E !!!,"To be honest the biggest mistake that will people do with this film is to misjudge comparing to the old move or TV serial.No this is a whole new thing.Congratulations to all persons who worked hard for making this movie.In a small amount of time they managed to do a film based on the old idea of famous ""Fame"" but combining a fast review of the old time TV serial parts as the looking of a piano or a Cello to keep the educational style without to be boring with the modern times psychology of artists and rapped all together with a whole new hip hop and rap modeling.Family problems co-exist on this movie too and acting as a bridge from the old times to the future career of the modern artists too.But to really understand and appreciate the efforts of making this movie , a tiny bit of artistic beat or music passion must circulate in your blood then you ll become a part of it , without it you ll never understand the meaning of this movie .I m saying again without the music educational level of what represents the name ""Kurtis Blow"" or if you are in the age above 40 and you don't feel forever young don't try to understand this movie you will be disappointed. Full of Excitement with big E !!! then so enjoy!!! This is a movie to make you live again and again and again...of course it could have been done better if Rudolf Nureyev was the dancer in his early steps but don't take it personal more Nureyevs will follow - accept it !",10
186,FAME? I think not.,"Fame was quite a let down I must say. I feel like I've just wasted about 2 hours of my life and $10 on a movie that I literally got up to use the bathroom during and had no drive to return to the theater other than it being my friends birthday. To start, there were so many main characters I didn't even catch half their names during the movie...except when there was some overly dramatic (yet insanely slow paced and boring) scene about how they were leaving school in which case their name was no longer important because their character was eliminated. It was hard to connect or feel any type of emotion for any of the characters because they were so disconnected and their background stories (if they had any) were incredibly vague. Needless to say I felt nothing when that one boy whose dancing career would supposedly amount to nothing contemplated suicide, he should have jumped, it would have brought something into this story. Its almost as if the people who created Fame felt some sympathy for every Broadway reject who couldn't make it into the chorus or background of a real show. Their careers will probably amount to just being ""Dancer #1"" in the credits of a movie. The singers, while very talented, were just showcased off for that. I have a feeling that this was the peak of their performance and in about two years time each will have a solo album thats being sold for $7.99 at the checkout line at your local Kmart. There is so much more to be said about this movie, but I feel like its being to harsh. Simply put: Fame sucked.",1
187,A Film With A Heart-Wrenching Message,"Oh, ye of little faith. This film had flaws as almost any film does but, there have been several criticisms about some less than stellar acting. It is true to some extent. Truth be known, several participants were the real people in the real world of the events that took place from the actual story. I am always amazed by the reviews that seem so opposite from agreement. This film dealt with the tragedy that sometimes befalls only some families and it shows that families can work thru their sorrows. I rate this film 7 stars because I know a similar tragedy and I pray that you never have to walk with this tragedy in your life. Quinn does an outstanding performance that conveyed the pain and suffering of a father as did the rest of the main cast. This is a heart wrenching story to watch but one with a valuable lesson to share.",7
188,amazing to watch,"This film does an excellent job of portraying how the unexpected death of a young teen affects his family, friends, and community. Have the tissues handy. Wish they had done a better job of including a sister and another brother into the story. Watch through the ending, when they share actual statistics of the Wake Forest football team in 2006. Also how the family moved forward to help others through a group they formed to educate about the organ donor program and the dangers of reckless driving. Yes I recommend it, James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 2/15/2021",8
189,"Good story, bad script","I had wanted to see this movie for a while, as I am a really big Aidan Quinn fan, so I was thrilled when I found a copy today! But my hopes were too high for the level of this movie. The story was solid, the acting was decent, but the script was obviously an afterthought to the football footage. The writers never really introduced the viewers to the Abbatte family (what was wrong with the daughter?), gave very little notice to the interactions and reactions of the family as a whole regarding their loss, and basically didn't give the actors much with which to present their characters or to move the story line. With such a good story and a high-caliber cast, this movie could have been a great one, but instead it pretty much just laid down with a whimper. Next time, guys, ""FOCUS"" on the story, not clips of football plays and cheerleaders. Really a sad treatment of a promising premise.",5
190,bad movie on a true story that deserved better,"I rented this out last night with high expectations. the story looked good and with the added element of sport,(American football). i thought great. this should be a good watch, how wrong was I. the movie began aimlessly with a bunch of actors stumbling from scene to scene while mumbling their lines from an awful script. the story was meant to be a very emotional one about loss and tragedy, but it was so badly done, that i found myself laughing at times where i should of been swelling up or getting tears in my eyes, i kept thinking wow, this is a true story, I hope the family this is based on haven't seen this, because if i was in their shoes, I would be really offended. everything was wrong, production, script,direction(there was none), acting, terrible, aidan quinn in particular must of gave his worst performance ever, crying and whaling his way through scenes. the movie picked up a little later on when they all finally eased on the crying., but overall a bad movie on a true story that deserved more than this. if you want to see a good movie based on a true story this year check out soul surfer.",3
191,Inspirational sports drama.,"This true to life drama begins in 2006, when Luke Abbate(Stefan Guy)accepts a ride home from football practice and ends up the victim of his friend's reckless driving. The out of control vehicle spins off a narrow rode at 90 miles an hour. Devastated parents,(Aidan Quinn and Andie MacDowell)watch their son die of brain damage in the hospital...only four days before his sixteenth birthday. The Abatte's donate Luke's organs to five people. Big brother Jon(Ryan Merriman), a junior at Wake Forest, begins to honor his brother by holding up five fingers before the fourth quarter of each game. When the news spreads, opposing players and fans begin doing the same. Was this the inspiration that guided Wake Forest to win a school record 11 games and a trip to the Orange Bowl? It doesn't take long to realize this was not meant to be an award winner. Albeit poignant, sad and uplifting. Dialogue not enough to brag about. Musical score at times irritating. Acting is pedestrian and MacDowell, as usual, overacts. This a very good movie for church groups. Inspiration can be found in tragic loss.Other players: Michael Harding, Jon Stafford, Andrea Powell, Anessa Ramsey and John Newberg.",2
192,Worth a try.,"Years ago, there use to be a dramatic Christian TV show called 'Faith for today', having seen it makes me think that these kinds of new movies are a bit of a modern version of that genre, dramatic Christian programming while at the same time, I have to say, it is not 'overtly' Christian in it's message vs. in comparison say 'Facing the Giants' but only in that Wake Forest is a Christian University, the ""Deacs"", Demon Deacons. Also in one scene in the Abbate household, I believe one might see a cross on the wall but even that seems a bit unfocused in the background and then, there is a short part in the Church but no ""Bible Thumping"" by any means.One should not be expecting a Hollywood production. You have to think outside the box. The movie has a message and in the end is moving and does recount that story well. The football action is fairly well done when it shows games. I give it 6 stars as being on the plus side of average. For a ""football movie"", I'd rate it as about 7 stars actually, interesting when you think of Wake Forest as I do as mainly a basketball power which they are vs. football. It may not be 'Brian's song' or 'The Knute Rockne story' but it might be slightly reminiscent of the feel of those movies and I would think of it as being more along the lines of 'We are Marshall.' It's definitely worth a try. Yeah and parts of it do make me a bit teary eyed. Also, from a sports angle, the parts with South African trainer Steve Uria are good, it makes me think of some of the real exercise parts of the movie 'Hoosiers.' Honestly, if you are into sports, the exercise portions may be something you want to try for yourself. Wake Forest is more famous for it's basketball teams, even at the football game, I saw some of the student supporters jumping up and down which is something I tend to see all the time watching basketball games of some Universities like, I've got to say it, Duke University. So, in the final analysis, I think there is quite a bit to this movie and it is worth watching.",8
193,Tries to hit all the stereotypes and fails miserably,"This is an amateurish movie. This is a waste of a ""based on a true story"" movie. -Acting is halfway decent and is not helped by the poor dialogue. -The background music/song selection is incessantly annoying because it feels over the top and forced. -Scenes jump all over the place and lack cohesion. -Even the sports part is about as unexciting as you can get. I mean how can you screw that up? Basically it's a bad movie and this is coming from a guy whose a sucker for this type of inspirational true story/sports genre. So in closing, is this a half assed review? Yes it is, but you know what, I felt compelled to tell the other side after reading the only other review which is clearly biased.",2
194,An Amazing Movie! - (bring tissue),"This was an absolutely amazing film. If you're gonna watch it, go to Walmart and buy a box of tissue for each person who's going to watch it with you because you will spend 95% of the movie totally choked-up. Truly an inspiration. Not to take anything away from any of the other actors in the film but this has to be one of Aidan Quinn's greatest performances. The raw emotion was overpowering while remaining completely inspiring. If you like true stories of how powerful the human spirit can be when faced with adversity then you will love this movie. I honestly can't understand how the overall rating of this movie is only 4.7. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to be a better person in all areas of your life, I'm inspired to be a better father and husband. I have met people like these portrayed in the movie so it's easy for me to believe they exist. If you're macho, watch it anyway, just watch it alone - but WATCH IT!",10
195,Career ending,"This is so poor, music awful for intense scenes. The experienced actor and actress are so bad. Career enders. Could of been a great film if script and directed properly.",2
196,"Good Movie, But Surprisingly Vulgar","Being a pastor, I was excited to see another faith-based movie. The movie was inspirational with great values supporting faith, dealing with the death of a loved one, and overcoming tremendous obstacles. However, I was surprised at the amount of alcohol that was promoted in the movie, especially when the mother was shown drinking shots with her friend. When she couldn't get her breath, I didn't know if it was stress or taking too big of a swig. There is a time or two when vulgar language is used in the movie. So, I would recommend this movie for Christian families, however I do not know that I would approve of watching this film in church. Do not let the eccentricities keep you from watching. Although this movie is not at the level of spiritual prowess that Fireproof and Facing the Giants are at, it is still a great movie overall.",5
197,Forgettable would be an overstatement.,"I must say that when renting direct-to-DVD movies, I never do expect anything great (this is not to say that I've never been pleasantly surprised by one in the past). I always make sure to watch these sorts of movies with an open mind and lowered standards.Sadly, I wish this movie could meet even my lowest of standards. Firstly, the acting was terrible (at best). All actors seemed to have been hired straight out of some sort of cheaply made orange juice commercial. The overall stiffness and completely off emotional queues were the only things of this movie ever coming close to making me cry. However, the most blatant offender in this film was Aidan Quinn's pathetically over-acted performance. Secondly, you cannot expect anything even remotely fresh out of this film. Nothing original; no artistic value: Classic ""Going-through- turmoil-but-in-the-end-we'll-all-be-alright"" Hollywood monotony. There is literally NOTHING special.Thirdly, they slap the ""Based on a True Story"" sticker to boot. It's basically a way to make you WANT to sort of like the movie, but really it only made me hate it even more. How dare they defile whoever's story this was based off of with this steaming pile of garbage of a ""movie"".Simply put: This was deplorable. A truly, truly horrendous movie.",1
198,How to overcome the death of a brother.,"The 15 years old Luke has died in a car accident. A great pain for the parents Maryanne and Steven and for Jon his brother. Jon is confused and doesn't participate in the sports activities of his university. But later he will find sense to his life playing American football with the number that his brother used. Other important thing, this film treats about the organ donation.Good performances of Aidan Quinn, Andie McDowell and Ryan Merriman.",7
199,an accident leads to a really bad movie,"Terribly written and directed. Terrible musical interludes in nearly every sequence. Preachy commercials about organ donation and the perils of reckless driving. It's too bad because the film could have been really great. There's a great cast. Films can have a faith-based message without being so heavy-handed, without all the bible thumping and scripture quoting.The idea of a good family coping with the senseless death of a teen-aged son is really a good idea--and one that already won the Oscar for best picture (Ordinary People directed by Robert Redford).This movie may have a slight life on the Netflix circuit--but it looks like it will lose about $5 million dollars. I've had a better film on my teeth.",2
200,"If you have a heart at all, you'll LOVE this movie!","Beautifully portrayed real grief and the humanness of this incredible family, from the high points to the lowest ones. Although I know Luke's story as well as anyone outside the Abbate family can, I was drawn into the movie by the raw emotional performances of the actors. For me, Andie became Maryanne, from her super human strengths I admire to her raw ""Are you kidding me?"" breakdown that made those of us who love her truly laugh out loud. Aidan's portrayal of Steven almost broke my heart. Aidan placed himself in Steven's shoes at the crash site and made those of us who are parents feel as helpless as he must have that awful night. Audiences are shown how God's grace is woven so beautifully in and through each moment of their lives, even when His presence is questioned by those hurt so deeply. I do wish we could have seen more of sweet Rachel and her lovely spiritedness!! Incredible movie, stayed true to the story of unending love, life born from tragedy and hope rising from loss. Incredibly well done. Definitely a must see-",10
201,A story with a special message of hope and resilience,We lost one of my sisters to a drive drunk and under the influence of drugs. It is necessary to continue to inspire our youth to take more productive pathways. The feeling of being invincible is a sad illusion. I love how the story of moving through grief was managed in this portrayal and the amazing initiatives that have arisen out of a needless and tragic loss and save and inspire many lives.,10
202,The worst movie I have ever seen,Omg holy corn fest. This is without a doubt the cheesiest piece of crap I have ever seen. I have lost my brother in real life and I still can't get over how terrible this movie is. I cringed pretty much the whole way through. The actor playing #5 the older brother looked like he couldn't pass for a middle school football player.,1
203,"Awful, horrible, horrid","This movie looked halfway decent from the trailer, and even though it appeared corny, we figured that being based on a true story, it would have redeeming qualities. Wrong! The acting in this film is so bad that Aidan Quinn and Andie MacDowell should be banned from ever receiving any future acting awards. The dialog is so terrible, it makes made-for-TV Lifetime movies look good. And the directing / editing just heightens the problems as camera angles accentuate the bad acting.We were able to rent this movie for free due to a coupon from a national DVD rental company. But even at that price, I felt like I was cheated.Think of the worst movie you have ever seen. This one was worse.",1
204,Good Movie,"I know that some people think that this is not a sports movie and that it used the ""guise"" of sports to promote a ""Christian"" theme. Well, the thing is, Christianity, in reality is just like this stuff in the movie. Sometimes we hurt. We're human. This movie takes you through the true- life situation of a Christian family who lost their son in tragedy. Their faith in Jesus is all that sustains them. The mechanism in this family's, or this brother's, case is football. It's not about the sport. It's about the family and their faith in Christ. People always try to down-play our faith and hope and demean them in any way they can. But for those of us who have a real faith in Christ, we know these are just the trying times and there is life after death. Not just the way we get by after an untimely (or ANY) death, and how to get on with life, but the way we know in our heart of hearts, there is life after death. There is eternal life...somewhere. Where will YOU be when that day comes for you? There is only the side of truth in Christ or the alternative, life in eternal pain and turmoil, that is, hell. I chose life in Jesus. I pray you will, too.",10
205,Good Family Movie,"Shelly (Alexa Nisenson) runs away from home and ends up at Ben Crowley's (John Voight) farm and she bonds with a horse she later names Orphan.Just like every now and then we need a great big juicy cheeseburger, we also need to see a very nice story about a 12-year old girl and a horse. Yes, at times, this will get a little sappy, but we know that will happen and we are okay with it. We have our Kleenex boxes at the ready.The real winner in here is the banter between Ben and Shelly as it is real, innocent and honest. This is a movie we never want to end mostly because we really like Ben and Shelly. I have never seen John Voight is a more comfortable role and I don't think he wanted this to end either. As for Miss Nisenson, she is 12 going on 30 and her character has had tragedy in her young Iife and her uttterances are full of honesty and truth. Ben has met his match and you may be able to see regrets in some of his reflections when Shelly causes some of his memories to surface.Notables: Vail Bloom as Caroline, Ben's estranged daughter; Phillip Boyd as Sheriff Jake, who wants to marry Caroline; Eva LaRue as Marta Jenkins, Shelly's foster mother; Scott Summitt as Gerald Jenkins, Shelly's foster father.This is a very good family movie and the dialogues are so good we don't want them to end. Now, do we want fries with that cheeseburger? Hmmm............... (9/10)Violence: No.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes.
Language: No.
Rating: A",9
206,Great family film,A well written story with the two main stars. Putting in a really great performance,8
207,Indie is Predictable But a Beautiful Movie,"Yes, this indie plays on your ""heart-strings"" and is predictable, but I thought it was a beautiful film. The two leads here Jon Voight and Alexa Nisenson are superb in their roles, and the supporting cast is excellent as well.Voight portrays Ben a curmudgeonly and aging man who has endured much tragedy in his life, but has maintained an affinity for his two horses which he keeps on his deteriorating ranch. Nisenson plays Shelly, an orphan who has just run away from an abusive foster family, and shares with Ben a love for horses.The chemistry between the two works well, and soon Shelly will also bond with the horse she named Orphan on Ben's ranch. Meanwhile, a search by the police and social services continues to try and find the missing girl.If you look past the cliches and just go with the flow of this movie you may find it as I did, most enjoyable and heart-rending. I'd say keep a box of tissues handy for the final 20 minutes or so.To note: there were no subtitles on my DVD copy.",8
208,"Very good movie, well worth the time to watch.","The two main characters, Jon Voight and Alexa Nisensen,play very well off each other and make you really like them. Voight's character is slightly reminiscent of Walter Matthau's in the movie Kotch. A superficially grouchy old guy who really cares a lot. One reviewer below seemed to dislike it because it was too cliched and full of tricks to tug at your emotions. He also complained that it had no subtitles. Subtitles?? It's in English, dude.Yes, it may be ""formulaic"" in the tearjerker style, but after all, when you get down to it, don't most movies, or stories, follow some sort of type? And this one is very well done.",10
209,2 tissue boxes worthy,This was a fantastic movie I love the storyline definitely keep a box of Kleenex tissues next to you. I cried through the whole movie it was wonderful I'd love to buy this movie for my grandkids,10
210,Genius in every way,Very good direction and acting!!! We loved the cinematography and editing. Wonderful story!!!,10
211,Nice film to watch with my elderly mother,"Picked up a copy of the DVD for cheap at the store because it sounded like an interesting and wholesome movie. We were pleasantly surprised. Yes, some of it was predictable, but it was still pretty clever how the story played out and things were tied together. It was not ""draggy"" at all, and held our interest throughout. There were a couple of times where we actually cheered. But you should also have a tissue handy.
The only real criticisms we had was that there were no subtitles (Mom is hard of hearing, and wears aids) and even when the volume was turned way up on her TV some of the dialogue was missed, even by me.
But overall, it was a nice escape -- especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lately we've been doing takeout lunch and a new movie, and this one fit the bill nicely.",8
212,Exaggerated,"Cheap, no subtitles, really poor audio and enunciation thus presumably dialogue (what people say) is not important. Very formula, lots of stereotypes & clichés to pull at the emotional heart strings. Really bad people running a small foster care/orphanage for money, and a few whippings to keep the innocent sweet little darlings in line thus our baddies to root against. One cute orphan escapes finds lonely rancher w/horses resolves his issues and, of course, a horse or two needs help. Horses play a minor role if you like horse movies. Not good acting, but good editing to make girl & horse connect.",3
213,Heartwarming Saga About a Grumpy Old Scrooge,"""Orphan Horse"" is a touching story about a cantankerous old horse trainer in Kentucky. He is mad at the world and despised in his community until he meets a young runaway child who is a natural horse whisperer. The story focuses on the bonding of the orphan child with an orphan horse, as well as the lessons learned by the old Scrooge.The theme of orphans abounded in the film. A pair of cardboard-cutout villains have adopted a large brood of children, then abuse them like characters out of a Charles Dickens novel. Young Shelly runs away and sleeps in the barn of old Ben Crowley, who discovers right away that Shelly is a natural when it comes to training horses.Jon Voight was perfect in the role of Ben Crowley. The rest of the cast was admirable in their roles. But the strength of the film was in the scenes with the horse, as trained by Ben and Shelley. The photography captured the verdant landscape of Kentucky and the quaintness of Midway, a town in which the train runs straight down the middle of Main Street.The film's ending may have been a tad bit far-fetched, as a nice cop and Ben's daughter Caroline get married, then adopt the entire batch of abused kids. This was a Hallmark-style ""feel good"" movie that had some heart, but went overboard on the sentiment at the end.",7
214,Terrible,"My friend and I watched this thinking it would be funny because of its cheesiness but we were wrong. Every scene made me cringe and the dialogue made me want to vomit. It was an absolutely atrocious movie that is a crime against cinema. If you're going to watch it, spare yourselves the trouble and go watch paint dry, it's that bad. Please for the love of all things holy spare your kids from this movie. If you find yourself watching it I will pray for you. The cinematography was like a train wreck except the train was full of small children and puppies, it was so bad. If satan were to watch this movie he'd cry.",1
215,"Pleasant, easy to watch, good family movie!","Don't listen to bad reviews! This is a pleasant, easy to watch, good family movie! Especially if you like horses and family!It's about an orphan horse (duh) and other orphans. Maybe that sounds depressing, but it is a delightful movie. And it has a happy ending of course.I guess there are a few parts that are difficult. IMO nothing that's going to drastically upset children, well, idk for sure. Depends on the child oc.Not sure if this qualifies as spoilers: Wolves, horse put down, horrible foster parents -- all rough stuff. OTOH no cursing at all, you don't actually /see/ anyone or any animal actually shot or hurt. But anyone mature enough will know what happened.There's also some intrigue - but I won't spoil it.Acting was good, the little girl, very good. And don't believe whoever wrote about audio being bad. It's wasn't I've /heard/ movies with bad audio and this wasn't bad at all. Production was good, filming, srsly no complaints.My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I actually teared up a little at the end. I'd recommend it to my kids and younger grandkids. Our youngest g-kid is 4 -- and he would enjoy it and would most prolly miss what happened to the horse badly hurt by the wolves...",10
216,Predictable and cheesy.,Terrible movie with only one good point - a beautiful horse. It must have been embarrassed to have to appear with such horrible acting by everyone and such a weak storyline. Can't imagine money being spent to make this. From the first 20 minutes you could tell every move that would happen.,1
217,"Serious, But Worthwhile","Parents should know that this movie has child abuse, a wolf attack, and a horse's death. But it's a good story of an orphan girl finding a family, and a grumpy old man connecting with people again. And the child abusers are arrested in the end.Jon Voight's a good actor. And I didn't have a problem with the rest of the cast's acting.Did anyone else think that the girl's mom was going to turn out to be Lucy? I thought Caroline would be her aunt.",8
218,A beautiful movie,"More than a movie about a young orphan girl's healing relationship with a horse who is also an orphan, it is a story of how this relationship also ends up repairing the lives of those around her. Exceptional acting and everything else makes this movie a great one for families with older children to watch. Keep a box of tissues handy.",9
219,Don't let your kids watch this!,"Child beating, lying, and shooting horses - all in the first 20 minutes! Not to mention letting your child watch such terrible acting and ""special"" effects. No reality whatsoever regarding wolf or horse behavior. I cannot speak to the rest of the movie, because I shut it off and erased from my DVR. Everyone involved in this turkey should be ashamed.",1
220,Heart Tugging Movie,"Of you want tears, and joy, this movie fits the bill. The relationship between John Voigt and Alexa Nisenson is probably the most heartwarming movie. I would recommend this movie for anyone.",10
221,"Good intentions, horribly executed.","This movie was in the Dollar Tree grab bin, for one dollar, if that tells you anything. I only give it three stars because it really was only one dollar. The only fun that came out of this movie was the fact that is was hilariously bad. Between the mediocre acting, stupid naming conventions, and predictability, I could hardly contain myself because it was so laughably bad.",3
222,"This movie is worth a 4, so I am giving it one star to balance things out.","It's plainly bad, boring, and nothing innovative. It's not a story that you would want to invest yourself into, because there are better movies out there. The only use I would find for this monster is displaying it in a bar and turning off audio.Why is it boring???????
It's boring because it is really foreseeable. Every situation in the movie is pushed artificially to where the movie wants to go. That is, it does not create plot points to smooth the narrative thread out, and develop the story so that it is naturally gathering in. Instead of that, it lazily pushes every scene of the movie so that it makes it unwatchable and cringey. In summary it is really unnatural and irritating.Why is it bad???????????????
This movie is bad because of unrealism. This movie is bad because of bad acting.
This movie is bad because of lack of social consciousness. Take for example this:
A character in the movie is talked down to by another character that is obliged by the situation to talk respectfully, and because of social standards. Don't understand me wrong, I ain't sensitive, but you got to be autistic in order to not know those kind of social norms. In summary, it is really unrealistic and really irritating so much so to to the point I shut it off because I had enough.
It tries something cute but copied so many times it's depressing. Well, maybe an 8 year old kid wouldn't be bothered by how the movie ""develops"" but hey, I ain't a kid no more, I am sorry. Maybe not.Why is it badly bad????????????????
Well, it is really an out of the box element for the majority, but the way the movie has been shot is really annoying.With those things said, maybe you want to watch: War Horse
Have a nice one!",1
223,This movie is very insperational,"While watching this movie the cogs in my brain start turning, the fact she renames the horse orphan becuase its parrents are dead really speaks to me. When I die i want my kids to have their names changed orphan in my honor.I would like to personally thank the writers for this beutiful moment, from the bottom of my heart. I also love how the horse feels so real, top teir CGI. Tho maybe the movie would be better with an animal that actaully exists like a moose or something. I still love the movie and can look past its ""horses""Most easy 10 stars ive ever given, I would give it 11 stars if I could.",10
224,Piché: A hero with a past. A great example of storytelling.,"Impeccably scripted, beautifully directed, with amazing scenery and filled with fine performances, Piché: The Landing of a Man is a wonderful example of modern filmmaking at its finest and truly a great example of storytelling. Directed by Sylvain Archambault Written by Ian Lauzon Starring Michel Côté, Maxime LeFlaguais, Norman D'Amour, Sophie Prégent and Isabelle GuérardThe story of an angel with clay wings, Piché: The Landing of a Man is based on the life of Robert Piché, a Montreal pilot who in 2001 guided a coughing, out-of-fuel Quebec jet over 100 miles of ocean, gliding the aircraft to a safe, screeching landing in the Portuguese Azores. In summary, Piche is a hero with a huge past. A past full of trauma and grief combined with alcohol, drugs and smoking. Piché – The Landing Of A Man was reckoned to be on of Santa Barbara International FIlm Festival's favorite films. I went in to the theatre with ratter big expectations and got very disappointed when it all started of like a student film and the feeling that I'd seen this exact scene about a billion times before. But I learned not to judge a book by it's cover because things were about to change. The director Sylvain Archambault and his writer Ian Lauzon made this story, based on true events, to something out of the ordinary. Piché is about a pilot named Robert Piché who lives in Toronto with his family. We start of with getting to know the impact media has on him after he becomes a hero and how he is trying to hurdle the attention. But his heroism is tainted and short lived. His family are suffering from being in the spotlight and at the same time having to deal with Piché's returned drinking habits. We go back and forward between his traumatic past and his sad present. We see how he was treating his earlier wife like nothing, how he is neglecting his daughter, his disturbing time in jail and at last the thoughts he has while spending time in rehab. It is August 23d 2001 and Piché is flying a plane with 306 people to Lisbon. When a gas leak occurs and the engines stop, Piché has to skillfully try to land the plane. Chaos erupts on board of the plane and it is very emotional to watch. He is successful and becomes a nation wide hero. All this in terrifying, white-knuckle silence, while 293 passengers and 12 crew members held their breath.Piché, who could teach Clint Eastwood a thing or two about flinty stoicism, brushed off any suggestion that he was a hero. Just doing my job, he told everyone afterwards. Weeks later, it is was revealed Piché spent time in a Georgia jail for drug smuggling. And that pilot error may have necessitated his heroic air show. Piché responded to all the praise and skepticism (maybe the adulation was harder to endure) by seeking refuge behind a forest of green beer bottles.The film Piché has the grabby feel of a potent TV miniseries. That's not entirely a compliment. The (English-subtitled) Quebec movie suffers from some of the weaknesses of the genre. An overemphatic script lands too hard on the pilot's early troubles: Surely, not every woman was lolling about naked in post coital bliss, a plume of ganja smoke curling above their shoulder, at the precise moment the young pilot entered a Jamaican drug tycoon's palace.And the harrowing Georgia prison sequence, which finds Piché chased by 400-pound would-be rapists, looks to be crudely lifted from the old HBO series Oz.Nevertheless, Piché remains effective melodrama. The film benefits enormously from filmmaker Sylvain Archambault's ( Pour toujours, les Canadians) brilliant casting stroke: having veteran Quebec actor Michel Côté and his son, Maxime LeFlaguais play the old and young Robert Piché. Cote, who English audiences may remember for his lead role in C.R.A.Z.Y., has the necessary confidence and authority to underplay his role, making the viewer come to him. He gives a mesmerizing performance that is made more interesting by LeFlaguais's more extroverted playing as the young, foolishly reckless Robert Piché.And screenwriter Ian Lauzon has wisely tinkered with what, in Quebec anyway, is a familiar story, shuffling the chronology of Piché's life. (The pilot became a Quebec hero in the autumn of 2001, when the rest of the continent was immersed in 9/11.) The film is told in haphazard flashbacks, with the young and old Piché confronting each other - a duel that allows us to better understand the pilot's torment.Another dividend of the filmmakers' time shifting is that the movie gets to revisit Piché's heroic flight for what is a tense, involving climax. The last 20 minutes is devoted to Piché's flight into danger. And history.Piché: The Landing of a Man is often overwrought, but seldom dull. For any national cinema to survive, it has to produce its share of popular, rousing melodramas. Piché raked in more than $3-million at the box office in Quebec inside a month earlier this summer. Alas, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is audience apathy, this kind of success has always largely eluded the English-Canadian film industry.Up until the plane scene the film is not really all that interesting. The prison scenes, filled with profanity are quite disturbing and the scene set in Jamaica (which was actually filmed in Cuba) I also thought was strange and unexpected. The cinematography is not very winningly and acting is mediocre. This is a perfect example of how important the story telling in a film is. If it wasn't for how great the story is portrayed in that end scene this film would have been something I looked at and then forgot. Now, I am definitely going to think about this every time I am on a plane.",9
225,A true and fascinating story.,"On 24th of August 2001 A Canadian pilot , Robert Piché, saved the life of 306 persons when the airplane was loosing kerosene, he managed to keeep cool and glided the plane during about 2o minutes to a safe place in the Azores.Robert Piché is not a common pilot, beffore this exploit he has a criminal past (he was in jail for smuggling) and was an alcoholic.
So this Canadian film tells the life Robert Piché before the famous filght oNo 236 of Air Transat and then the exploit of Robert Piché, Dirk de Jager and the crew during this flight from Toronto to Lisboa.
The role of Robert Piché is played by the well know French Canadian actor, Michel Côté ,I have seen him in ""La vie après l'amour"" (2000) and Omertà (2012).
It's really a very good film with great moments of suspense.",8
226,I love Rena Riffel!,"When I first saw the name of this movie, I feared the worst. ""Trasharella"" initially sounded like the kind of low-budget dreck that a studio like Troma would release as a bad parody version of ""Cinderella"" but with even less chance at cult status than any of the other ""-ellas"" already out there. But, when I saw that Rena Riffel was not just the star of this but also the first time director and producer, I was intrigued enough to give it a chance. I'm glad I did too.The movie begins in black and white with occasional added digital effects including some faux film scratches and a grainy look to make everything look more ""grindhouse"". It's not done perfectly but you can see what was intended and it isn't too distracting. Some useful ""Zombie Walk"" extras show off their make-up briefly just to make sure that everyone knows that this is going to be a horror fairy tale.It's during these scenes that we learn the origin of a vampire curse on Hollywood starlets which began 75 years ago during one of Helena's past lives in France. Everything turns into a silent movie for a while and it's a clever idea. My only real criticism of this section, taking into account the low-budget, is that technically it needed to be a bit blurrier and darker to make it look more like old footage. Rena looks great though as an aspiring silent movie actress and hams it up nicely.Then we're back to the present day and things switch to colour. Everything still stays grainy though and saturation levels are changed from time to time to slightly posterise the look of what now turns into a live-action comicbook adventure.In spite of the presence of a stereotypically Jewish vampire Count, there's nothing too horrific in any of this apart from a lot of the obviously improvised dialogue. Some aspects of this work better than others and there are some good lines but they are few and far between. What set this out of the ordinary though was when Rena suddenly burst into song. I really wasn't expecting that at all.The songs in ""Trasharella"" wouldn't be out of place in a bigger budget Hollywood musical though they are equally camp enough for fans of Rocky Horror too. Rena Riffel has a beautiful voice which sent shudders down my spine during the very catchy ""Perfectly Imperfect"". There's another catchy yet not quite so memorable song by Count Smokula in the middle but the final number, which I think is called ""Beauty is Pain"", performed again by Rena Riffel, reminded me a lot of Blondie. Yes, the musical numbers really are that good! While not being entirely a ""girl power"" movie, there's a definite female empowerment message at the heart of ""Trasharella"" and some not too thinly veiled satire/social commentary about Hollywood in general. Count Smokula comes across as representing male oppression through the ages while the starlets themselves are forced to become sleazier and trashier to succeed. It's not giving too much away to say that, when Helena transforms into Trasharella with the aid of a Betty Page wig, magic lipstick, and magic pumps to conquer the vampire's curse, it's not without severe consequences to her own psyche. Perhaps I'm reading too much into it, as it is supposed to be a comedy, but the whole film could be considered a warning that if a girl wants to succeed in showbusiness then the necessity of becoming trashy will be detrimental to her mental health. Tom Challice has the most memorable comic performance for me as Helena's psychiatrist, Dr. Simon Fieldsgoodman, when he turns himself into a Red Injun brave while taking notes of her problems. I know I should find Count Smokula more amusing than I do but I also found him to be a bit too sinister to carry the comedy off.Other notable things about ""Trasharella"" include some fine naked boobage on display from Mary Carey (as Lucy Les Rue) and Rena herself. An amusing laundry room tease had me thinking that Rena was going to keep her goodies covered up for the whole film but thankfully she didn't. There's some almost erotic lesbian sexual tension between Helena and Lucy but it doesn't really come to anything. A tiny girl to girl kiss much later (involving sharing the magic lipstick with Jade Paris as Becky Bardot) is also over far too quickly. There are no sex scenes as such though because, quite simply, they wouldn't add anything to the plot one way or another.I also have to mention the TV Batman-style fight scenes with on screen ""Kapows"". I wish that they had gone on longer mainly because I could watch catfights like this all day especially if they involve Jade Paris.With all its flaws, ""Trasharella"" is firmly entrenched in the ""so bad it's good"" genre and only falls short slightly from having a guaranteed cult status. If you are into Ed Wood then you'll love ""Trasharella"". Comparisons to the British ""Razor Blade Smile"" (from 1998) can also be drawn as Trasharella is an equally iconic character to Eileen Daly's Lilith Silver but without the vampiric elements. Perhaps if Trasharella had become a leather-clad vampire rather than a trashbag-wearing vampire slayer then she would have been even sexier.Apart from her physical charms, Rena shows that she has a considerable amount of talent. In truth, she's a Jill-of-all-trades and most of her creativity is yet to be tapped but ""Trasharella"" is very much a step in the right direction.""Trasharella"" is simply the most refreshing low-budget, independent movie that I've seen for a long time. It's not a horror movie and is certainly not going to win any mainstream awards but you won't be disappointed if you like bad movies which are intentionally made to be that way.",1
227,An Unusual Film With Little Plot and No Direction,"Helena Beestrom (played by actress, writer and director Rena Riffel) wants to be an actress... but is scared by the stories she's heard about the vampire who can turn into a black cat. Along the way, we hear the story of her previous life and meet the vampire.This movie is just odd, and unless you're a Rena Riffel fan, I'm not sure if it would really be something many people would like. Low quality cameras were used, so the filming is pretty bad (sometimes on purpose, sometimes not). The sound is bad. Family members were called in to play impromptu parts (though, in all fairness, I think her parents did fine as French people).Count Smokula is enjoyable, singing and playing his accordion. And when he pops up early on in the film, I really was digging his look. But he can't carry the film. There's also an extended scene with Mary Carey (playing burlesque dancer Lucy Les Rue) that consisted of little more than her and Rena trying on various outfits. I didn't really understand it.Now, don't get me wrong. I like Rena Riffel. I like her as an actress and I like her as a person. And I really did enjoy this movie. But critically it's a mess, with the low grade sound, video and the disjointed plot. I loved the Paris flashback, but then the plot seemed to go from aspiring actress to a woman who just wanted to wear leather instead of granny panties. There wasn't a strong undercurrent of a plot or character development. This has a good ""cult"" element, but it's not something I can recommend to everyone.",5
228,Fantastic love story,"A self abusing mentally unstable girl finds herself a job as a secretary in a law firm owned by mysterious Spader. The two start a kinky relationship and their lives change dramatically in the process.This is really a beautiful love story. It's quite unusual subject matter (the nature of their relationship) may cause some viewers to discard the film, which is a shame 'cause this film is really nothing but a romantic little story about two people, who feel alienated and alone, who find each other. The need to find a kindred spirit is something we all want, no matter how different we feel we are from the rest. In some ways, the charming ending, when they finally get together, reminded me in some ways of the ending in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"". Hope someone will relate to that.The acting is superb. James Spader is fantastic as the troubled lawyer and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as well. This is a well written, well directed and moving film that is sure to delight all those who are open minded to some unusual twists in an otherwise universal love story. 9 out of 10",9
229,Not Your Typical Office Romance,"Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant portrayal of borderline psychotic, self-mutilating Lee Holloway, a former mental institution patient seeking to sustain herself - vocationally and emotionally - in a challenging world where she has few safe harbors.  She comes from a messy family background although that alone can't explain her illness.Learning typing, she gets a secretary's job with lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader, who also turns in a first-rate, nuanced performance).  Grey refuses to have any computers in his very smart, expensive law office. Like many lawyers he's a perfectionist who abhors typographical errors but his obsession with perfection reflects more than an anal personality hitched to a law degree.  His solo practice seems to thrive better than his self-control of a suppressed sexuality, awakened by Maggie at first unknowingly.This is a film about what many consider to be deviant behavior (sado-masochism and bondage-discipline, not your usual Hollywood romantic fun and games) that most will concur is uncommon in the workplace.  Director Steven Shainberg and his cast - and Gyllenhaal and Spader carry the film, forget the supporting actors - show Lee and Grey's rocky and developing relationship with candor, without condemnation and without exploitation. The lawyer and his secretary are sexualized in a way few have experienced and those who have don't talk to folks outside their circle.This is a black comedy/a black drama.  It either grabs or repels the viewer: there's no in-between.  The resolution?  Is it realistic or a cop-out?  I'd love to hear from those able to comment from experience on IMDb's discussion board.  But I have a feeling few will post reactions.A very different film that I rate 8/10 on a personal scale where I value the deep and tortured acting projecting the absorbing conflict of this sexualized working (initially) relationship.",8
230,Very original,"'Secretary' deals with a daring and original subject and does this in an effective and funny way. Its subject is sadomasochism, its genre is a romantic comedy. The secretary is Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who suffers from self-mutilation, her boss is Mr. Grey (James Spader), who seems the coldest man alive. When they are in the same room you feel that there is something there, they both feel it too. Since the movie opens with a certain S/M scene we already know that there is a point in the movie where the two must find each other and start the sadomasochism activities. I will not reveal how and when it happens, but the moment is great.Saying too much about the story would spoil things. We laugh at the right times, which is a good thing. Considering the subject it is even hard to accomplish that since people who are not familiar with it laugh very easy when they see strange things. For most audiences the events will be strange. The original approach of the movie, the performances perfect for this movie, the funny moments and an ending that plays exactly as it should this is a good movie and one of the most original romantic comedies I have seen.",8
231,"Thoughtful and yes, sentimental.","Those Gyllenhalls, they sure can act.  Maggie, like her brother Jake, turns in great performances like they're routine - she makes it look easy.  In 'Secretary', she delivers a layered, complex performance as Lee Holloway, a disturbed young lady who deals with stress by cutting herself - the pain pushes away everything else that's bothering her.As she's released from an institution back into the world, she takes her first job as secretary to lawyer E. Edward Grey, played by James Spader. From then on, the movie explores their relationship and how it affects Lee, taking her from the quiet, self-damaging wallflower into the determined and strong woman she becomes.  The film's use of S&M in the relationship between Lee and Mr. Grey makes it a bit controversial, but it's not really the focus here.  The idea of Lee as the submissive and Mr. Grey as the dominant have little to do with their sexuality and everything to do with their personality issues.Lee can't handle extreme emotion without resorting to pain, because she can't take control of her own life.  What she sees in Mr. Grey is love - absolute love, the likes of which she can't find with her fiance Peter (Jeremy Davies).   That love allows her to give him the power of her pain - by doing that, she's finding something worthy to focus on instead of the nothingness of her sewing kit and iodine.  Mr. Grey, for his part, is a man who can't deal with anything except in his own ordered, regimented way.  He cares for his orchids but little else, and the steps he takes with Lee open up his wary heart.  He's slower to develop than she is, and to take the final steps towards a real, lasting relationship, he has to be dragged there by the force of Lee's own will.The key to this film - and S&M relationships in general - is that Lee (the submissive) has all the power, not Mr. Grey (the dominant).  She sets the terms by which the relationship will be conducted, seemingly for the first time in her entire life (including the relationships with her family).  Lee finds love and desire in Mr. Grey, and pursues it while healing her own shattered psyche in the process.Maggie Gyllenhall is luminous here.  She can say more with a facial expression than most can in a Shakespearean soliloquy.  She gives herself completely over to the part, without a wink or a nudge that she's just kidding, or thinks any part of this is silly.  She becomes Lee Holloway, which is the best compliment you can give an actor.  Spader, for his part, follows in a long string of oddballs, but doesn't go over the top, as he could have been tempted to do.  This is Maggie's movie, and he supports it and plays off it well.Rating: 8/10, based on the strong performance of Maggie Gyllenhall and the character of Lee Holloway, but nocked down due to a poorly-constructed finale that just doesn't fit with the rest of the film.  Highly recommended.",8
232,"Two great performances, one great film","The word ""originality"" has been overused, especially by me, so much that it has almost been beaten to a pulp.  After all, how can one really tell if something in a film hasn't been done before?  Well, I can confidently say that Steven Shainberg's ""Secretary"" may be the most inventive, and yes, even original, film this year.  I can confidently say that in all of my time of watching and reviewing films, I have never seen anything like it.
Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from a mental institution due to the fact that she constantly would cut herself when tension started to build up around the household.  After she is released, it is clear that the habit has not been broken, but cuts or no cuts, she needs a job.  She goes to typing school and gets some of the highest grades in her class, making her perfect for the position of secretary at a nearby lawyer's office.  She goes for the interview, and after seeing the previous secretary run out in tears and hearing the questions in the interview, it is apparent that the lawyer, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), is a bit of a creep.
Soon enough, Lee begins to cut herself at work, and needless to say, Grey catches her in the act.  He doesn't take any sort of disciplinary action towards her.  Instead, it seems that he can relate.  He tells Lee, very inspiringly, that she will never cut herself again.  Lee is uplifted, but has no real inclination as to just why he said what he did.  However, she still continues to make mistakes in her writing, and after a while, it simply drives Grey nuts.  He invites her into her office and tells her to ""Lean over, put your elbows on the table and read the letter outloud"". She does as he asks, but in a strange turn, he spanks her every other word. She runs into the bathroom hurt and embarrassed, but interestingly enough, she loved it.I'm a bit surprised that even by this time, there has been little controversy over ""Secretary"".  I had images in my head of feminist groups rallying for the film never to reach the screens, or possibly screams of NC-17 from everyone's favorite censors, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  Thankfully though, it's gotten this far unscathed.  Maybe that is because audiences at preview screenings and film festivals are realizing that although loaded with thick layers of kooky (but not that kinky) S/M, the situation is a deeply and fundamentally human one.Basically, if S/M was ever shown in a film before, it would usually be in the context of a villain torturing a hero against their will, and usually such scenes weren't in anything that wasn't some cheap exploitation film. ""Secretary"" is a brave endeavor, but it knows where it's going.  This isn't a gimmick, S/M sequences in the film are not the least bit perverted (the same can't be said about some segments in several Larry Clark films). These scenes are essential to understanding the characters.What is so great about ""Secretary"" goes beyond its offering insight as to why anyone would find being tied to a pole and spanked while holding a carrot between their teeth even remotely attractive.  Despite pretty morbid subject matter, ""Secretary"" flies off the screen with energy and wit, offering some of the funniest, most surprising dark comedy I have seen since ""Fargo"".  Several scenes in the film have already become classics in my repertoire of movie moments that will stay with me forever, including one hilarious incident involving a worm.Even with all of this, there is no way that ""Secretary"" would have pulled it off without Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.  Spader is creepy and oddly pathetic; his performance is such that at one moment we are sympathetic, the next we are booing him, then we're intrigued again.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is equally brilliant; she gives us complete access into the mind of Lee Holloway, and it's close to impossible not to feel for her.  Also, take into account how courageous she is; you try and find me another actress her age who would be willing to do half of the things she does in the film.Spader and Gyllenhaal have such chemistry that everything clicks. Director Steven Shainberg lets us truly understand the complexities of their relationship without letting the energy lag or any of the subtle comedy fly past the audience.  ""Secretary"" is invigorating, touching, hilarious, and often all at the same time.  With too many romantic comedies trying too hard to try something new when they are in fact only going backwards, ""Secretary"" is a truly unique specimen.",9
233,I just want to watch it over and over and over again!,"WARNING this review contains SPOILERS:This film is beautiful in so many ways; Maggie's portrayal of a submissive was just pure delight. She did SUCH an incredible job in every scene involving her and James Spader. I mean the part where he first starts spanking her...her eyes...they were just so expressive! Even though she didn't really talk you could totally understand everything that was going on in her head through her eyes. Just beautiful!And James Spader! wow...I've always been impressed by his acting and have always found him incredibly attractive and sexy, but after viewing this film...I fell completely in love with him all over again.Even though the movie really centers around Maggie's character and her battle with sexuality and cutting and what not...I found James' character's battle to be more intriguing and actually bigger. He's become completely intimate with her and every time he even looks at her he wants to bang the sh*t out of her. So his way of dealing with that is through exercising. And his whole obsessive complusiveness was, well to me, kind of funny.Some of my most favorite scenes in this film was when James fires Maggie yet she doesn't want to leave. He sits down in a chair and she comes up to the side of him and starts running her fingers through his hair. The expression on his face while she does that is just so enthrawling! I mean just the touch of her makes him go into an orgasmic bliss! I also love the scene where She is lying naked on the grass and he is rubbing his hand over her stomach touching every cut and scar. And you hear her voice over talking about how she used to be shy about having sex because she didn't want anyone to see her cuts; she was so ashamed of herself, yet he didn't care at all about them and loved her for everything she is. She felt beautiful when with him and wasn't ashamed anymore. It was just fantastik! And my 3rd favorite scene was when James starts kissing maggie and works his way down her body, and while he's doing this she starts asking him questions like ""I wanna know when your first love was, when you had your first kiss, what your favorite color is, where you were born..."" and he had worked his way back up and stops right above her face and answers her question about where he was born. She then gets this big smile on her face right before he leans closer and kisses her deeply. I don't care what anyone else says, but that scene had my heart racing a mile a minute, it was so sweet.Despite all of the things that had happened in the past these 2 found acceptance in each other and because of that will love one another forever. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film. You will become so attached to it I swear! my rating is 9/10.",9
234,A Unique Kind of Love Story,"This one was really a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a black comedy as well as a movie that deals with kinky fetishes. It's both of those things but, surprisingly, it's also a very nice and sweet love story. Yes, really. Maggie Gyllenhaal is wonderful. I think this is easily my favorite role of hers. She's funny, adorable, and sexy. James Spader's great but Maggie really makes the movie something special.Obviously not for all tastes but I would say that you should try it out, even if the BDSM stuff doesn't float your boat. I think you'll be surprised at how much you like it. One thing that I would like to address is that I see a lot of other reviewers who liked the movie saying they hated the ending. Gotta say I can't disagree more with this. I assume these people would have preferred a more downbeat ending. Frankly, that would have ruined the whole experience for me and I would have subtracted points from my score. The fact that the ending left me with the warm fuzzies is a large part of why I enjoyed it so much.",7
235,More tease than strip,"In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn't just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss's love object. The film actually isn't quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn't really all that important. The film isn't really about obscure sexual preferences, it's about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it's that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it's shock value; but to be honest, you don't really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it's portrayal of S&M however, as it's a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different.As mentioned, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the title role and starring opposite her is James Spader as her boss. Gyllenhaal's character is sweet, inexperienced and bashful. She's very easy to like, but she can also be annoying at times. Spader's character is the complete opposite; despite being insecure, he comes across as being cold, calm and collected. He keeps his emotions hidden inside and reveals very little about himself, unlike Maggie's character who is happy to wear her emotions on her sleeve and doesn't seem to mind what other people think. Observe the way that the boss continues to tell her to put her shoes on because her feet stink etc; not exactly the most conscientious person to ever walk the earth. Despite being chalk and cheese, however, the two characters blend together in a way that is both believable and interesting, and this makes for some great chemistry between the two leads that is hard not to enjoy. The fact that they are chalk and cheese is a help and not a hindrance to the film as it serves in making it all the more interesting. My only quibble with the characterization is the ending, which although it brings the message out, seems tacked on and rather unrealisticbut it's not enough to spoil the film.Overall, Secretary is not a masterpiece, but it is a very good portrayal love, and one that is far superior to dull and dreary films such as 'Lost in Translation'. It's entertaining for it's duration, there are several funny moments and the central message, which states that it's worth going to extremes for the one you love is a worthwhile one for any movie, even if it is someone lost under the premise of the movie. Recommended.",8
236,"I'd Like That Coffee with a Spanking, Please","""Secretary"" is a deliciously off-beat dramedy about an emotionally disturbed young girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who gets a job as a you know what for an attorney with his own set of personal problems (James Spader). Soon, she's doing more than typing for him, and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell. This film on paper sounds almost exactly like ""The Piano."" A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse, and opts for the perverse one. In both films, what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs.""Secretary"" is not as sombre as ""The Piano,"" however, though it's not as rowdy as the premise might lead you to believe. It's actually a quite substantive film and only occasionally did I think it faltered somewhat in telling its story (particularly toward the end, when Lee embarks upon her hunger strike). Ironically, in offering herself up for submissive humiliation from her boss, Lee finds the strength she needs to face her own demons and forges a confidence she's never before had.Gyllenhall is spectacular, and gives one of those performances that should put her on the map as a serious actress, if anyone is paying attention. Spader is pretty good too, but he's upstaged by Gyllenhaal, who owns this movie.Grade: A-",8
237,When a Masochist Meets a Sadistic  An Unconventional Love Story,"Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a self-destructive and submissive woman, with suicide tendencies, who has just left a sanatorium after a breakdown. She has a kind of kit in a box for self-inflicting pain when she feels in trouble. Lee decides to get a typing course and when she finishes it, she decides to look for a job of secretary. She finds an advertisement in the newspaper, goes to an office, and the lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader) hires her. The details is that Edward is sadistic and a very dominating man, who humiliates Lee most of the time. Of course they will fall in love for each other, after many funny situations. This low budget movie is a wonderful unconventional romantic comedy, one of the weirdest I have ever seen, supported by excellent lead actor and actress and an original screenplay. The always-excellent James Spader is one of my favorite actors, and Maggie Gyllenhaal gives also an extraordinary performance in this film. The situations that Lee uses to tease Edward are hilarious. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ` Secretária' (` Secretary')",8
238,"Look, we can't do this 24 hours a day, seven days a week.","Did they get a casting award for this picture? Yes, they certainly did, and it was well deserved. It is not often that casting is perfect, but it certainly was here with Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader, as the secretary and the boss.Spader is a lawyer who is extremely anal and has some weird taste in decorating. His proclivities for domination come later. Gyllenhaal is fresh from rehab and needs a job. As luck would have it, Spader has a flashing sign in front of his office much like a ""Vacancy"" sign at a motel. Secretaries don't last long at this office.In the context of sado-masochism, this is a love story. It's a strange love story, but it was sweet and tender and Gyllenhaal was nothing short of magnificent.",8
239,Original to say the least.,"The movie its story is highly original and the movie's subject is handled in a good way. It is what makes ""Secretary"" a one of a kind movie experience.The movie beautifully tells the unusual love-story of the secretary (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and her boss (James Spader). The two subtly slowly develop a sadomasochistic relationship at the office. It's a subject that is not handled very often in a movie (atleast not in serious manner) and that is what makes ""Secretary"" an unique movie. It tells the story slowly and with lots of dark humor, making this movie a light and fun movie to watch rather than an heavy drama.The movie is carried by director Steven Shainberg and the main cast. Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader (Hard to believe it's the same guy who played Daniel Jackson in ""Stargate"".) are acting really solid and make the story work and make the movie believable. Other solid performance comes from Jeremy Davies. This guy is on his way of winning an Oscar in not too long from now.The subject is handled in a good and believable way but the movie is 'too little' to be considered controversial or a must see and it has a bit too many odd moments. It just is a fun solid movie that you will not regret watching.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7
240,Must watch!,"I do not like SM, Maggie Gyllenhaal I never liked and comparing this to ""50 Shades of Grey"" was a complete deal breaker. But finally, I decided to see it because of James Spider. I like him a lot. And now I'm sorry that I did not see this movie back in 2002. because then I could use the past 15 years to see it a dozen more times. This movie is unbelievable. It is based on SM relationship, but it is more about love and determination to fight for what you really want. Spider is good as always, but Maggie was a real surprise. I never saw her this way before. Beautiful, sweet and good actress. I underestimated her unfairly. And the music was done by Angelo Badalamenti, author of legendary ""Twin Peaks"" soundtrack. Movie hypnotized me completely and two hours was not long enough. I was horny, crying and laughing all at the same time. I cannot recall any other movie ever had such effect on me. It blew my mind. This is one of easiest tens I ever gave and I'm a miser when it comes to rating movies.10/10",10
241,A romantic comedy with a difference,Protagonist Lee Holloway has recently been released from a mental hospital but she still hasn't got over her compulsion to self-harm; she goes on a secretarial course and gets a job with lawyer Edward Grey. He seems a little bit old fashioned; insisting that Lee uses a type writer for all his letters then he starts to chastise her for her occasional typing error. She strives to do her best but he keeps finding faults then one day he calls her into his office and instructs her to bend over his desk and read what she typed while doing this he starts smacking her bottom. She is surprised but rather than complaining about assault or sexual harassment she realises she actually likes it. So begins a relationship where she is totally subservient but nothing really sexual occurs and when it finally does it looks as if their unusual relationship is over. All the while she is 'sort of dating' Peter; a fair more conventional man; he loves her but he doesn't excite her; in the end will she go for what she truly wants or be ordinary?This is certainly unlike most romantic comedies and all the better for that; it certainly avoids many clichés. The two leads have a real chemistry; Maggie Gyllenhaal does a great job as Lee; somehow managing to come across as both fragile and empowered Lee may be in a submissive but that is where she wants to be in the relationship and what Mr. Grey does to her is less harmful than what she was doing to herself and James Spader is almost as good as Mr. Grey; a character who is harder to like as he frequently comes across as bullying and uncaring and despite being the one in the dominant role he is the one disgusted by his actions. I was somewhat surprised at just how funny it was at times. If you have heard that this is a 'pervy film' and you are looking for something naughty you may be disappointed but if you want a different sort of romance you should give it a go; it is a lot of fun.,9
242,"Well-produced, and a respectful and fair representation of something widely considered to not be usual","I know, that isn't exactly something that one comes by every day. If you don't look closely enough, this might appear to be little more than a plea for accepting those who don't follow the typical norms(an aspect that this does have, but it's not the focus), which wouldn't be outright bad, it would just not be as noteworthy as this is. Heck, some might expect this to be mere thinly veiled erotica. That couldn't be farther from the truth. This is about love, intimacy and discovering one's identity. While it is arguably provocative, and it was an intentional decision, that isn't at all the point of it. This is an empowering film, and it's rather well-made, as well. The plot is engaging, and interesting throughout. Every acting performance is spot-on, Spader is excellent and Gyllenhaal is absolutely flawless, bringing these credible, well-developed and human characters to the screen. The script is marvelous. Pacing is well-balanced, this never loses you. The humor is great, very funny, dark, occasionally sardonic. Dialog is well-written and impeccably delivered. Editing and cinematography are skillful. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer, B-Roll(or, in this case: behind-the-scenes) footage and about half an hour total of interviews with the two stars(showing that Maggie *really* understood what it was all about) and director Steven Shainberg(who also leaves no doubt as to the fact that he knew exactly what he was doing; I am most definitely going to seek out future movies by him). There is moderately frequent sexuality, a little nudity(for details, consult the Parental Guide), occasional strong language, as well as disturbing content(the amount, I suppose, depends on each individual audience member's personal tastes and boundaries). Maybe not for everyone, though I hope many will watch it. A courageous exploration of romance. I can see why the studios balked; long live independent cinema! I recommend this to anyone intrigued by the concept. 8/10",8
243,"oh, james, oh, maggie...","How refreshing!!  It has been quite some time since I went to the movies and walked out feeling I could wholeheartedly endorse the film I just saw.  When asked why this film was so good by my coworkers, I responded ""the actors' performances, the sets, the script, the content, essentially everything.""  And so it is, everything. Thank the spirits that flow someone still has the ability, honesty, and energy to make such a film in the land of fakery and deception. While the relationship depicted is that of a sadist and a masochist and this is what will get played up in the press, the point is the relationship and the near impossibility of love working without complete honesty.  Bravo.",10
244,"Quirky, fun, and everything I ever wanted in a film!","""Secretary"" is everything I have ever wanted in a film: romance, humor, drama, and kinky sex! The incredible chemistry between an amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal and a repressed yet fierce James Spader is what makes this movie work so well, and the tender depths to which their relationship is portrayed makes it so much more than just a film about sadomasochism. I felt that the main theme of the film was to show that people have pain, and it is only when you accept that pain that you are able to feel your emotions fully, therefore making your life much more livable. This movie was a bit quirky, and might not be for everyone. However, I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. ""Secretary"" is by far my favorite film of the year.",10
245,My new favorite James Spader movie!,"I saw this movie twice & want to see it again... & again... & again. *LOL* I really enjoyed it. At first I thought that it might be too risque for my taste, but I was pleasently surprised. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of risque, but it was played out so well that it just blended. I was amazed when I realized that this movie wasn't ALL about Sub/Dom, but in fact it was a love story. I wasn't disappointed. I recommend seeing this film if you haven't already, & even if you have. =)I am a very big fan of James Spader & he was so amazing in this film. He was beautiful, funny, complex, & sexy. I'll be his secretary any day.
I was also surprised by the fact that I liked Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is a very good actress & alot more attractive than in any of the pictures I have ever seen of her. Everyones acting is Superb, the directing superb, & the story *****!!!!!! My raves don't even do this movie justice. Just go see it!-M",10
246,I guess it's a Belgian thing...,"Maybe it's because I'm Belgian, but I actually really liked this film.So the film doesn't have a well-developed storyline, but those who really bother about that don't seem to get the point of this film. All this film attempts to do, is to create a totally paranoid atmosphere for an hour and fifteen minutes... It attempts to do so mostly by focusing on the emotions of pretty regular young people, creative camera angles and a creepy soundtrack. In my opinion they most definitely succeeded. It might have helped that I smoked a joint on forehand, but I really felt on the edge throughout the film.After coming to the realisation that the film was shot on a very limited budget and in a very limited time frame, I was really impressed.",8
247,"Fascinating, tight little thriller ... why are so many viewers confused by this film?","There are so many people confused by Artefacts ... frankly, I'm confused why everyone is so confused! If you just pay attention, and give the attention this film requires, you'll understand plenty. Just because it has an open ending, that doesn't mean answers weren't given.Kate is a career gal that seems to have things going for her, except for a failed relationship. All of a sudden her employee and friends start turning up dead, killed by doppelgangers. Even the news reports mention a strange metallic artifact (spelled artefact in the film, due to its Belgian production I assume) that has been found inside each victim. Kate finds that her own doppelganger is hunting her down, and the implant is possibly a tracking device for the doppelgangers to find each victim. The arrival of each doppelganger is preceded by a clicking, ticking sound as well. Through investigation on the internet she finds a big clue to what is going on around the world, and she is just another pawn in the whole thing.She then meets up with a man named Carl Francken who reveals just enough for us to know some of the ""why"" of the situation but only just a tidbit to keep us in the dark and still trying to figure things out. In a way this would have made a great X-Files episode, much of the atmosphere and story fit that well. I'm also very much reminded of the wonderful 2008 feature ""The Broken"" with Lena Headey (which equally baffled many U.S. viewers but, if paid close attention to, gave more answers to its mystery than Artefacts does). There is also an ""experiment/game"" element that reminded me of the 2005 film ""Experiment."" However, Artefacts is a story and film of its own, and I feel holds up well.These days, particularly in U.S. audiences, people want easy answers and wrapped up solutions in their movies. If they have to think while watching a film or try to think some more after the credits roll, they get angry. I've read some very severely hateful things in comments online about Artefacts, The Broken, Session 9, and a good example -- the 2001 film The Wind, where people just didn't get it. They were upset that they had to think, figure things out, and put the puzzle together. They weren't easily handed blood and boobs on a platter; just angry that they had to do a little work as well as sit back and watch.Artefacts, to me as well as some open-minded friends, turned out to be a tense well-made, well-acted thriller, and smartly made on a low budget (only $100,000) with an intriguing premise and execution. I love to view it with friends as a double-feature with The Broken, as each has its own strange world to absorb and mess with your head. Some folks may say it's a European thing, but I sure welcome a viewing challenge and for me it paid off quite well. Oh, it's just plain creepy too...",9
248,"It could've been good, if they had a real ending for it","The movie's only an hour and fifteen minutes long, and a portion of that's taken up by the end credits, so it's very short. The end credits mention something about a Belgian Tax Shelter, which may explain this movie's existence.The DVD cover, incidentally, has nothing to do with the film.It did actually hold my interest up to the ""ending."" People are being killed by their doppelgangers, who appear accompanied by odd static. The police find metal ""artifacts"" in their bodies. There's an amusing web search at one point where the heroine searches for ""artefact in bodies"" or something like that. That would bring up a lot more results than she gets, and she actually finds more or less what she was looking for.But anyway, in the end the artefacts and the doppelgangers are not explained. Nor is the non-explanation satisfactory in any way. I might have given the movie a 6/10 or 7/10 if it sustained the interest with the ending, but the failure to have a resolution really damaged it for me.The special feature indicates this was shot in 12 days for $100,000 with a cast of 10 and 20 locations. It sounded like they originally wanted the actors to work off the synopsis rather than use a script. For a movie on a limited budget with a limited shooting schedule, that's a real mistake. The dialogue and acting in the film is actually fine, it's the plot where the film falls flat at the end, with no wrapup. I'm not really sure where the $100,000 went. Maybe just towards paying the cast and crew? They do blow up a car....The special feature does offer a very little additional information about two of the characters that one could not possibly get from the film. However, the director either really did not have an explanation, or plays coy. Supposedly, budgetary restrictions kept them from offering a real ending. They're open to the possibility of a sequel or a remake. I'm doubtful whether they'll get that opportunity.",3
249,Not a bad film at all,"I rented this from Blockbuster through the mail, since my local store does not carry it. I rented it despite the low ratings here on IMDb, mainly after seeing the trailer for the movie.This was not a bad film at all! In fact, I rather liked it. The story was interesting. There was plenty of suspense, and just enough gore. Sure, they might not have ended it so abruptly, but all the questions this movie leaves me with gives me something to think about. There is a lot left to the viewer's interpretation.I enjoyed it, and recommend the movie to you. It won't win any awards, perhaps, but it is worth watching.",7
250,good up to the ending soured me off the film,"Kate, a business woman in her mid-twenties, is having nightmares of her closest friends winding up dead that seem to become reality in this tense, slightly unnerving little film dealing with dopplegangers. Made on a shoe-string budget over a couple of mere months this sci-fi tinged thriller is pretty damn good (for the most part, the ending is atrocious and 'end's nothing). It was a breath of fresh air to see a film that doesn't automatically (and wrongly) equate mindless gore with big scares. Kudos to the film makers for not going that route. And at merely 75 minutes (including credit rolls), this film is lean in a good way & rarely drags. But, I must say again, the ending pretty much soured the movie for me.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: A 52 minute Making-of (that's almost as long as the film itself); a trailer for this film; and Trailers for ""Bangkok Dangerous"" (the US remake), ""the Spirit"", ""Restraint"", ""Kitchen Privileges"", ""Raising Jeffrey Dahmer"", & ""Bram Stroker's Dracula's Guest""",4
251,"Nice try, but not at all scary.","The premise of this movie was okay en kept me curious for like 10 minutes. After that the many shortcomings of this production took over until the end. I watched a piece of the DVD's extras, where the makers of the movie told that they did it in 12 days for 100.000 dollar. They sounded sympathetic enough, but this movie is definitely not a Blairwich Project-kind of surprise, because as a supposed horror-flick it fails on the most crucial part: it's never ever in any way even a tiny bit scary!It's about a girl finding out that she, her (ex-) lover and a bunch of close friends all have been implanted with some metal artefact in their bodies, which all of a sudden attracts their exact Doppelgangers who are out to kill them. There's hardly an explanation, not even in the end, just some mystifying innuendo's like: ""high people from 'up there' (meaning aliens from outer space??) are playing a game with you"". The whole movie we see a lot of running around through ugly streets and houses, while the Doppelgangers conveniently announce themselves by way of a strange rattling sound. No graphic violence whatsoever, hardly any blood, and one car exploding (probably costing the most of the films budget). That's about it.Then there were a lot of annoying things, like the strange accent of the actors (were they originally Belgian?), the bad acting of the rather scruffy looking male main character, and the uninventive and amateurish special effects. The script rattled. How and when were these metal artefacts implanted? Were they born with it? What were all these evil Doppelgangers supposed to do after they killed the original persons? Take over the world? And why this complex scheme of planting an artefact to attract the Doppelgangers - if these ""people from up there"" were so technical advanced, couldn't they just have sent the Doppelgangers to the earth without the need of such a clumsy mechanical beacon??All in all I was not impressed.",3
252,Overlong short movie in disguise,"ARTEFACTS tells the story of a woman who realizes that her circle of friends are killed off one by one by their evil doppelgangers.ARTEFACTS feels very much like a short movie stretched out to barely make it a full-length feature. The production values are low, there is not much of an explanation given why things happen, which is particularly frustrating because the doppelgangers behave inconsistently. Consequently, there is not even a point in trying to guess what is going on. Finally, the concluding speech by the Doctor is just baffling in that it seems totally out of place, almost as if it was lifted from some unrelated romantic drama.It is much easier to get away with lack of explanation in a short film, because the economy of time only permits audience to be drawn to other possible aspects, like the ambience, emotional appeal, aesthetics etc. Without getting disengaged or bored. A longer film can pull this off, but it is much harder, because the parts that make up for absence of sense have to be especially strong. This film has nothing to make up for the absence of the plot explanation, so basically we get a cat and mouse game without rhyme and reason.The one aspect of this movie which stood out positively was the noise that doppelgangers make as they approach; it is genuinely unsettling, and, given how simple the sound effect is, I am surprised that I had not seen (heard) this in other movies.Overall, this is not really a worthwhile film unless one is a evil doppelganger movie completist.Some movies which make much better use of the concept:1. INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1978)2. THE STEPFORD WIVES (1975)2. THE BROKEN (2008)",4
253,Interesting Movie,"I was very surprised with this movie, for I expected the worst out of a B horror flick. However, the acting was quite good (particularly Mary Stockley..the main character). It was also thrilling and deep. In addition, the soundtrack was not weak, as it usually is in these types of cheap movies. I would recommend seeing it; it is entertaining and existential. If nothing else, you may find the leading lady a sight for sore eyes. That's about all I am going to say without giving away anything. If you like to watch people get chased, then you'll more than likely dig this movie. I gave it an 8 out of 10 for its originality and depth.",8
254,Artifice,I liked the story but it leaves a lot of loose ends. That bothers me. It hints at a sequel or a series but I'm totally unaware that anything came of it. The story is fairly new to me which gave it at least 5 stars. I didn't give it 10 because I get irritated if it's just part of another untold story.,7
255,"Looks like a Student Film -- No Production Values, Bad Camera Work, Bad Acting","Dear filmmakers: please do me a favor--don't put your student films on the shelves of my video store as if they are actual movies made by professionals. If you can't afford to build a set, you have to actually use LIGHTS to shoot. And on the subject of shooting, please use a real camera, and not a $200 hi-8 video camcorder to shoot your picture so it won't look like a grainy mess.Dear potential viewers: save your money. Better yet go rent a movie that's actually worth watching. The doppleganger idea has been done before and there are a slew of movies that have done it better. Invasion of the body snatchers springs to mind.",1
256,My Review,"Young entrepreneur Kate (Mary Stockley) is experiencing the deaths of all her friends in very odd circumstances. Soon she discovers that they're being killed by their dopplegangers, and it all has something to do with an artifact that was implanted in each of them.""Artifacts"" had the power of being something better than what it was. With a total running time of 1 hr and 14 minutes (including the opening and closing credits), it seemed that the directors didn't really care about making a great story. The artifacts aren't explained, nor is anything else really, and the ending was so abrupt that it didn't warrant any closure. It could've been great, but instead it was crappy.",4
257,More Like A Filmschool Project,"I bought this DVD out of the blue, I wanted to be surprised. The movie focuses on a young woman named Kate who finds out all of her friends and co-workers are murdered by their doubles. At no point this is a mystery for her because the doubles make no effort of concealing themselves for prying security cams. While the police seemingly makes no effort of solving the case (?) Kate runs for her life and tries to save as many friends as she can. The style of photography is guerilla at best, which gives the movie a documentary-like feeling, especially in the rare action scenes. Unfortunately, because of the underground touch, it never accomplishes to be scary or intensive. Also, the writers have forgotten to include any and all explanations as to where the doubles are coming from, who made/grew them, who are controlling them and why, what are the artefacts for, etc? I like my fair share of mystery and mysticism, but there is a difference between letting the viewer decide what to make of it him/herself, and just leaving everything open. I have to say that I am impressed with the time schedule, because the documentary points out that three guys did all the work in a little over a month for only 100,000 dollars. I also have to say that the acting felt a little staged. Kate appears to express total anxiety as her neutral emotional state and you basically care little whether she lives or dies. Overall, it feels more like you are watching a filmschool project rather than an actual movie.",5
258,Avoid like the plague.,"Some movies are bad because of the acting, the budget, the camera-work or other such things. Those movies, you detect easily and either don't pick them up at all or at least stop watching them and wasting your time. ""Artifacts"" is much, much worse than that.Clearly, it's a low-budget movie, but it's actually well made. The acting is decent too, as is the soundtrack. So it lures you into thinking it might, actually, be a decent movie. Don't be fooled.Because, you see, ""Artifacts"" didn't run out of budget at the end, it simply ran out of plot. You never find out anything about the doppelgangers, the artifacts, the foreshadowed ""Carl Francken""... it all just goes completely unexplained. None of it makes any sense. At all. And they can't even play the ""it's about the characters, not the plot"" card, because it's blatantly a plot-driven movie... without a plot.Frankly, I find this kind of movie an insult to the viewers.",1

Performances and camerawork are good, beautiful landscape is clearly visible (hopefully nobody thinks that birds-animals were created using computer!) and at present, with no snow at all, it is pleasant to acknowledge that winters in Estonia tend to include lots of snow and whiteness.",8

262,Typical movie but not too impressive,"This is a typical Suresh Gopi thriller movie- Crime,investigation,action,dance,dialogs...but still I did not find it too impressive. It is unnecessary of some Malayalam movie makers to try and portray Christianity in the negative,giving all villainous characters Christian names,using verses from the Bible as dialogs in the negative,Using biblical events as ideas in the film.All this is not warranted.Otherwise Gopi's acting is good,Siddique does well as the villain,music is fine.The film can be watched once,but I personally feel Blasphemy is wrong.",5
263,Could have been brilliant...,"The concept surrounding this movie was/is unbelievable - that a bracelet of sorts could regenerate cells - ultimately bringing a dead person back to life...This is all made possible by time-travel - a prisoner from the future manages to travel back in time with the aid of a scientist (Judge Reinhold)'s machine, looking for who he believes to be his soul-mate of sorts...Unfortunately, Jennifer Rubin (who plays the soul-mate and wife to C. Thomas Howell) and her acting ability, coupled with the poor writing, in areas, really really destroyed the potential for this movie...I have the utmost respect for C. Thomas Howell - I personally think he's one of the best actors around - and it's a shame to see him in a film that really could have been a success...I feel that if a more talented director and more thoughtful screenwriters had entered this project, 'Last Lives' could have been brilliant...[4/10]",5
264,"Campy, but not completely unfortunate due to the fine scenery....","*** MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** OK, I'll admit - had Billy Wirth not been cast as the bad boy for a good cause lead in this flick, I wouldn't even have bothered picking it up.I thought C. Thomas Howell's acting was lackluster at best (check him out in every scene at some point sporting a pained face like he's constipated in a major way) and though I tend to enjoy Jennifer Rubin's work, she didn't show me much here. Judge Reinhold was non-convincing as the brainiac scientist from the planet Smartron (for obvious reasons - Lee Press-On mustache and using the same goofy delivery as when he had th brain of a preteen boy in Vice Versa). The plot? Well, let's just say I tend to agree with a previous review that questioned how Adrienne (Rubin) could possibly fight off Malacki's (Wirth) advances to get back to the loving arms of Aaron (Howell). I believe love is a powerful force, but ladies, have you SEEN the eyes on the ""villain""? There just wouldn't have been any resistance from me, I'm afraid. I'd have flown the proverbial white flag, suffered through the ""agony"" of being Malacki's true love (and all that entails) and reflected fondly on the memory of my ex-fiancé once in a while. Once in a GREAT while.This movie isn't THAT bad, but it wasn't in any danger of sweeping the Oscars, either. I'm not sorry I've added it to my collection, but it's not because of story line, direction or special effects. Sorry, guys - for me, this one is all about the eye candy. Period.",5
265,Time Travel Hits A Wall,"Being a time travel fan I was disappointed in this film for a few reasons. I think the director could have thought out his ideas a little more, and the script, I had a feeling some of it was lost along the way. The actors needed more direction and input than they got.I liked the ideas of the bracelet bringing people back from the dead, the trouble was the wrong characters kept getting brought back.Jennifer Rubin is a gifted actress and the director and the writer did not help her at all in this film. She seemed confused and lost in a hopeless plot.Billy Wirth did what he could with what was given to him in the writing and direction.  It would be hard for any actor to pull off more than he did with this script. I know many Billy Wirth fans and women in general are still wondering why any normal woman would have a problem deciding between Wirth and Howell???For the most part I liked the special effects it was the writing and length that killed me, I wanted to stop the film cut the car chase by 30 minutes and move on.  Someone had a good idea but it went very wrong somewhere along the way.Not a bad popcorn movie, will probably end up on peoples ""films we hate but want to watch"".",8
266,A decent temporal flick hamstrung by a stupid gimmick.,"Story Synopsis: In a dimension parallel to ours, the convicted terrorist Malakai is being used as a guinea pig in a temporal experiment designed to send people across parallel worlds. Convinced that his dead wife exists in our world, he hijacks the experiment, sending himself & two cohorts over to our world. The scientist who created the experiment also crosses over, armed with a number of bracelets that can revive the wearer in the event of death. He uses one of these 'lifebands' to resurrect Aaron, the fiancé of the woman Malakai abducted, having being shot by him as he tried to save her. The pair then gives chase but the scientist is killed in the process. Before he dies, he passes the 'lifebands' to Aaron, who then uses them to attempt a highly risky & dangerous rescue of his love.Film Analysis: Last Lives is a low-budget knockoff of the Terry Gilliam time travel flick 12 MONKEYS (itself a knockoff of a French new wave film known as La Jetee). Both films cover the same story - a criminal is used as a subject in a temporal experiment due to his obsession of a woman from another world or time, the experiment going awry because of this. The only difference is that while 12 Monkeys is an intelligent & darkly humorous time travel flick, Last Lives is a film with a severely limited scope.As an action film, Last Lives is competent enough, with some decent car chases, shootouts & explosions. But it fares less well as a sci-fi film - namely due to the rather stupid gimmick of having the hero armed with special armbands that can help him cheat death. Sure, the gimmick is interesting but the way it is used here is quite silly - as the hero, Thomas C. Howell is killed so many times that it is not even funny. Okay, I take that back - the various ways that Howell kicks the proverbial bucket are so contrived that you will be laughing out loud over it. Case in point being the shack explosion, with Howell's scattered body parts reforming despite the explosion's effects (surely it would've affected the armbands as well?). The temporal experiment is just a MacGuffin used to launch the story, promptly being written out by the end of the first act.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Howell is pretty good despite having some sort of Southern accent that affects his performance slightly. Judge Reinhold looks like he is embarrassed to be there while Jennifer Rubin seems to be under the influence of some serious sedatives. As the villain, Billy Wirth (who has proved himself to be a capable actor in the past) is given little to do, making the most of his role as a telepathic terrorist with a pair of silent henchmen & painful telepathy as his only weapon.",3
267,An interesting twist..,"A terrorist from an alternate universe whose great love was killed, comes to this world to kidnap her counterpart in this universe. The counterpart is about to get married. The terrorist kills the entire wedding party during the kidnapping. A scientist from the alternate universe tries to stop him. That is the plot of ""Last Lives"", a low budget sci-fi thriller.Basically, I really enjoyed this flawed film. For the money, the special effects are effective. We are all use to films where the antagonist keeps springing back to life after we think he has been killed. It's a very inventive twist when it is the hero who keeps coming back to life.There is one major flaw with this film. The three leads, Jennifer Rubin (""Screamers""), C. Thomas Howell (""Soul Man""), and Judge Reinhold (""Fast Time At Ridgemont High""), have proved themselves very competent actors. The problem with the entire cast is that you soon realize each of them talk in a very wooden cadence. Since everyone does this, the fault must be that of the director, Worth Keeter. This coupled with some very bad background music detracts from the film.That said, there is enough in the film for me to recommend it. A number of reviewers have savaged it. I feel it's a nice little film well worth a rental from Netflix. Rent it and decide for yourself.",7
268,Good idea .......,"They should remake this film, perhaps with a different cast, perhaps with the same one but at least another few million in the budget. The story is interesting enough to deserve a makeover. It's been done before - LA Takedown and Heat for example.  I'd grade this a ""C+"" and a ""could try harder"".",5
269,Give a 9-year-old a word processor.... and tell him to write a screenplay,"I give this film a 4 but I think its rather generous since all 4 points are earned for humor value. This film can be summed up as such : Judge Reinhold gives a masterful performance as Merkin, a trans-dimensional inventor / scientist of sorts who chases a homicidal lust-driven maniac through a space portal that goes to Earth. Maniac and his two cronies come to Earth to steal the girl. All three baddies are armed to the gills with devastating weaponry whose clips never run dry. Scientist gives girl's fiancée some bracelets that, if worn during death, will recreate organic tissue and bring the wearer back to life. Fortunately there are a bunch of these bracelets so the fiancée can die a bunch of times. Judge Reinhold dies in a fiery car explosion, bringing a tear to anyone's eye in his Oscar-worthy performance about ""being a man who has no fear of death"". In the end, the cronies die, the main baddie gets his just desserts, and the fiancée gets his girl back.This movie is a bona fide turkey. If this film had hit the box office when I was 8 years old, all the boys in my 3rd Grade class probably would have loved it. Unfortunately I would not show this to any 8 year old, in fear that this priceless piece of Americana would leave my young impressionable friend with a jaded opinion of American cinema. I have three bits of advice regarding this film: TO THE WRITER: Next script, write yourself and don't let your kid do all the work.TO JUDGE REINHOLD: Stick to Beethoven flicks.TO THE PROSPECTIVE AUDIENCE: Unless you're like me and find humor in all the movies your friends can't stand, leave this one on the shelf and rent something much better, like Weekend at Bernie's.",4
270,"Poor film, no point.","Although the film has a good base of an idea, it has so many unrealized ideas that it is a pointless waste of time.  There seem to be no redeeming features, and the relationships have no real emotion to them.  The bad guy doesn't seem that bad, the good guy seems wishy-washy, and the only character that I liked was the cop.  Disappointing.",2
271,Harsh reviews but really half decent movie(spoilers),"I fairly give it a 7 because of the novelty of this film.What was the novelty?...well let me get philosophical here and tell you there were some deep and existential ideas to the films plot.Have you ever played video games? Of course you have. Did you notice when you died, you got another life?...or a limited bunch of extra lives?...Well THATS EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER IN A MOVIE HERE. Maybe it has been done in some other ways in other films or shows...but this film literally made use of ""bio-bands"" or whatever they were called that restored a persons ""life"" if the person was blown up or injured. The heal devices were bracelets and with them, the main character had literally ""nine lives"" like the saying goes for cats who escape death...And the kicker is in mythology we all know about ""releasing the bonds of Orion"" and perhaps you people may find interesting doing some investigation into the ancient mythological devices called ""kesatot"".So, yes the movie needed ""something"" but I really couldn't figure out what...perhaps the direction was too ""cheesy"" or 80's movie-like (specifically the non-speaking goon helpers of Malakai)and needed a more mysterious flow/atmosphere...maybe more blinking lights...but, overall, all the acting was great (atleast good). I found the whole concept and plot of this movie satisfying and even romantic (lost loves through time).",7
272,Clooney Plays a Weird Story Straight Up,"What if the creator and host of two of the 1970s biggest and lamest television game shows was also a part-time CIA hitman?  That he used The Dating Game and The Gong Show as a cover to stage assassinations in the netherworld of Cold War espionage. Ridiculous you'd say. But that's what exactly what Chuck Barris claims in his autobiography, and Charlie Kaufman accepts carte blanche as the premise for his screenplay. The film plays it straight up as if Barris were telling the truth. Can Charlie Kaufman, the screenwriter, and George Clooney, the director pull it off? Mostly. It is competently acted by Sam Rockwell as Barris, Julia Roberts as a fellow spy, Drew Barrymore as his love interest, and director George Clooney as his CIA recruiter and handler.  The bizarre landscape, a marriage of television and espionage, is presented without a smirk or wink. If Barris is telling the truth, this is what it must have been like. It's an interesting idea, and Clooney and Kaufman have taken it and crafted an enjoyable film.",7
273,A highly disarming dark comedy,"One of Charlie Kaufman's more overlooked and underrated screenplays, 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' may have been something of a departure from the high-concept experimentalism that made his previous brainchildren, 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' (a masterpiece and a near-masterpiece, respectively) such striking breaths of fresh air, but on no account should its ability to engage and entertain on those strengths of its own be underestimated. Taking a well-earned break from the surreal situations and the complex plotting, Kaufman turned his attention here to a much more straightforward yarn that was better grounded in reality; the twist there being that it was based on a story that, while allegedly true, just as likely never happened. 'Confessions' though is willing to give Chuck Barris the benefit of the doubt in regards to his dubious claims to have been a secret assassin for the CIA in the midst of his days as a game show host, giving life to such controversial classic as 'the Gong Show' and 'the Dating Game' while taking it from a range of human targets around the globe. It sits back and lets the scenario unfold without question  and does so with such considerable spirit and vigour that it's hard not to get lured in and pulled along for the ride. Regardless of whether the real-life Barris truly did have some incredible adventures within his time, or simply an overly-active imagination, this movie translates it into one heck of an enjoyable romp  slick, stylish and entrancing on the surface, and with a bracingly poignant and sobering tale lurking underneath.Kaufman continues to rule supreme with his flair for developing the most heavily flawed and eccentric of characters, investing them with witty dialogue and sharp situations and, as with his previous screenplays, the humour is a pleasantly mixed bag  lightly amusing at some points, laugh-out-loud hilarious at others, even outright alarming whenever it needs to be. George Clooney's direction, meanwhile, though it stands a fair distance from the eye-seizing zippiness that we're used to seeing Spike Jonze apply to this writer's workings, is still an accomplished visual take on the material, made sensational by its meticulous attention to detail. Indeed, the film's fondness for subtle in-jokes, crafty cameos (some great ones among the Dating Game contestants  absolutely great), background gags and general all-round intricacy is partly what makes it so rewarding and worthy of repeated viewings (I was watching it for what must have been sixth or seventh time last night, and still I found myself picking up a whole range of details that I somehow missed out on the first few times around). Sure, things can move a tad slowly every now and then, but with this number of niceties up there to be marvelled at you know you're never for a second going to be bored.It also draws a fine contrast between the two separate pursuits that Chuck Barris is called to follow  the game show scenes are colourful, light-hearted fun, the assassin scenes murky and deliciously paranoid, and Sam Rockwell, at the helm as our savvy and hapless main man, has the timing, the energy and the appeal to emerge from the two as both a comic figure and a tragic one. Kicking off as a likable, familiar kind of anti-hero, whose goofy grin and offhand ways have us smiling through the bar fights and the womanising, he gradually evolves into something more enigmatic and sorrowful; a lost, confused individual whose more innocuous contributions to society, in the form of lowbrow 'trash TV', are widely scorned (not that I've ever seen any of the genuine Chuck Barris's shows myself, but it would amaze me if they were really any worse than the kind of mind-numbing reality TV that's enjoyed popularity over the past few years), while the hidden talent he discovers in contract killing begins to understandably repulse him soon enough. One of the most effective things about 'Confessions' is just how deftly it uses its gags and its pathos, along with interview snippets from those who were acquainted with the real-life Barris, which punctuate the story at various points, to reflect upon this man, his life, and just how much he really achieved either way, arriving in the end at quite a biting conclusion. I don't think that any other rendition of 'If I had a Hammer' could feel nearly as sad and haunting as it does here.Drew Barrymore and Clooney himself offer nice support all the while, each epitomising different ends of the Chuck Barris spectrum  Barrymore, as Chuck's bubbly girlfriend Penny, is a fun-loving innocent; Clooney, as his CIA director, is aptly subtle and mysterious. But neither of them, or anyone else involved for a matter of fact, comes even close to upstaging Rockwell, whose input is simply fantastic  there's no doubt in my mind that the Best Actor Award which, as the blurb on the DVD so proudly states, he picked up at the Berlin International Film Festival for his efforts, was well-and-truly earned.It's not an innovative, far-out, one-of-a-kind experience (a la 'Being John Malkovich'). But it's an entertaining, well-made and entirely satisfying flick with one particularly brilliant stand-out performance, and that's more than enough to do the job. Kaufman can probably pen avant-garde better than anybody else today, but 'Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' goes to prove that, when in the right company, he can write 'normal' just as impressively.Grade: A",9
274,Clooney makes a very nice debut as a director with this movie,"Since ""ER"" George Clooney has been a very popular actor, mainly because so many women find him very attractive. But through the years he has been able to prove that he's more than just a pretty face in the crowd. He has acted in many popular movies and did it pretty well in most of them. But being a good actor doesn't mean that you are automatically a good director as well of course. So before seeing ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"", his debut as a director, I had my doubts...This time we don't get to see Clooney very often in the movie itself. We only get to see him a couple of times as the CIA agent who has hired the game show impresario and producer Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell). During the day Chuck invents game shows like 'The Dating Game', 'The Newlywed Game' and 'The Gong Show'... Shows that are all very successful, because they are easy to understand and fun to watch. But next to his regular day job he is also a CIA assassin. At least, that's what HE claims to be...I must say that Clooney has done a very nice job in his debut as a director. He has added a nice surreal tone to this movie which makes it even harder to understand whether all this really happened or not. And even though this is a bio-pic, it is never hard to keep watching it or to stay focused. Thanks to the light and satirical feeling in it, this movie stays fun to watch from the beginning until the end. Of course without the interesting story and the good acting by all of his main actors Clooney wouldn't have been able to make this movie. Withouth them this movie wouldn't be the same and might even have been awful to watch. Especially Drew Barrymore was a lot better than I had expected. She never really convinced me in her other movies that I saw, but this time she's really good as Barris Sweetheart. And Clooney himself was interesting to watch as well. Even though he could be found more behind than in front of the camera, he still proves to be a talented actor.Overall this is an interesting and fun movie. Certainly because it is Clooney's debut as a director. The man sure has a lot of talents and I'm already looking forward to his next movie as a director / actor. I give this one a 7.5/10.",7
275,Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: 8/10,"George Clooney's directorial debut is a compelling dramatic biopic about `Gong Show' host Chuck Barris, who claims to be a hit man for the CIA. Barris started out small, but decided to go for the big time and move to New York, where he got a job at NBC. Soon he becomes a manager type person, and creates an idea for a game show called `The Dating Game'. It becomes a hit, but he feels unfulfilled, even though he has Penny (Drew Barrymore). Also, Jim Byrd (Clooney) from the CIA recruits Barris to kill for the CIA. As we watch the movie, we don't know which is true and which is a figment of his imagination. Think of it as an R-rated Beautiful Mind.Barris is played with great intensity by Sam Rockwell. Clooney took a risk of planting a not-well-known name as the lead. With such star power behind him like Clooney, Barrymore, and Julia Roberts, he stands out. Rockwell has starred in such movies before like Heist and The Green Mile, all three times with great acting. He brings out the inner demons of Barris. Rockwell was exceptional, and exceptionally believable. Even though he was billed fourth, he has his name out now and we can expect him in larger things.Many scenes were standout, with their camera angles and unique way of playing it. At times it seemed like a play, with a wall disappearing, for instance. However, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind wasn't as funny as I was hoping. Sure, some scenes were quite funny (like the scenes in the beginning where it was a montage of the f-word). It had an authentic feel to the 60's (including the soundtrack), like Catch Me If You Can did. At times, it had a documentary style to it, which would have been more effective if they had more substance behind it, such as more of the interviews or none at all. Many of the camera shots were close-ups, which looked quite cool. I am a game show aficionado, so I thought that most of the time would be spent on Barris going onto the CIA, but it was evenly divided between the two, so I was happy.At times, the mood was light-hearted, almost satirical, but at other points it was serious drama that poked at your emotions. As I said before, Rockwell is definitely lead material. Clooney did a good job portraying the CIA recruiter, and Barrymore is the other standout as Barris' girlfriend. She and Rockwell, besides good chemistry, both displayed true emotions. Roberts, as another CIA agent, put in her usual mediocre performance, though she was better than normal. However, many characters have no substance behind them, namely Roberts, who was billed third and had about three scenes (which, I guess, is better than Jennifer Aniston in Office Space).Possible the only downpoint of the movie was that at times, it got too trippy for its own good. Even Barris didn't know what was real and what wasn't. It got a little too muddled in plot, such as who is who, at times. When Barris sees everyone who he killed, that was justweird. Anyway, I would highly recommend Confessions of a Dangerous Mind to about anyone.My rating: 8/10Rated R for language, sexual content and violence.",8
276,Confessions of a Dangerous Mind: Deftly Avoiding the Gong,"While quite very obviously a well crafted lie sold as truth this movie does not fail to entertain and was one of the more underrated films of the year of it's release. A commercial failure the film was re-released later based on word of mouth buzz. This film appeals to a fringe audience that remains just out of reach of mainstream films. What do you expect from a screenplay written by Charlie Kaufmann? This film is a telling of the story of Chuck Barris, creator of various TV shows and all around uncomfortable guy. Barris holds many stations in life, TV producer, songwriter and CIA assassin. The meat of this story is not so much in his occupations but the mental condition and back story of Barris throughout the film. With something lurking just below the surface of an ambiguous nature you aren't certain if you should root for Barris or despise him.Through various twists and turns you follow what is one half mockumentary and one half spy thriller the film plays it very loose and fast and it let's your mind run wild and free without the burden of tension that a spy thriller would give. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy strong acting performances mixed with offbeat plots.Clooney takes what is basically a poor mans ""THE KID STAYS IN THE PICTURE"" and makes a very entertaining and watchable film with great acting and stylish but reigned in technique. Finally a someone takes the theory of taking a bad idea and making a fine film and makes good.",8
277,"Good directing debut, under Cohen brothers' influence","What is a worse crime - doing bad television, or killing people in the service of the CIA? That's how I would define in a few words the subject of this film. This film claims to be inspired by real facts, and you may believe it or not. Actually, in the strange world of American pop culture it is not that important. Killing in the name of democracy does as bad a service to democracy as the TV reality shows do to culture. So that if the principal character happens to be a reality show producer and host, as well as  a CIA paid killer during his free time, it makes sense or in the language of the movie - it fits the profile. George Clooney's first film is well directed, and there are little or no elements to show that he is a first timer in directing. The only observation would be that the story telling seems to be too much inspired by the Cohen brothers work, especially 'Oh Brother' where Clooney was the star. However, the Charlie Kauffman's script is as original and as well written as you expect from Charlie Kauffman, and the result is good cinema - in American cinema terms and scale. Sam Rockwell who plays the main character is little known, and as I hear was chosen after bigger stars were considered. Good choice I would say, and if the choice was Clooney's it proves that the man has a future in directing as well, not only in acting and heart breaking. Drew Barrimore and Julia Roberts are both good in playing the opposite characters of the two sentimental interests of the main character.Good entertainment, and not a brainless one for a change. 8/10 on my personal scale.",8
278,Surprised This Film Doesn't Get More Credit,"""Confessions of a Dangerous MInd' was excellent and I'm surprised it doesn't receive more credit.The story is an 'autobiographical' tale of TV producer Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) who doubles as a CIA-assassin. The movie is based on the book with the same name and the beauty is that no one knows if Barris made up this story or if the events are true. Regardless of its reality or not, the film is a tremendous example of great movie making.This is an all-star movie. George Clooney stars as CIA-agent Jim Byrd and also directs the film. He has such a cinematic eye. The scenes in which he incorporates the movie with real- life clips of the game shows is brilliant. The acting is superb with Rockwell delivering what should have been at least a Golden Globe nomination. Also in the movie is Drew Barrymore (delivering one of her better roles), Julia Roberts, Rutger Hauer, and cameos by Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Maggie Gyllenthaal. The cinematography is superb, and Director of Photography, Newton Thomas Sigel, creates a film with such innovative lighting and tones, and to top it off, the screen play is written by one of Hollywood's best, Charlie Kaufmann (wrote 'Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, Eternal Sunshine).The movie was shadowy but not dark, humorous but not too light, mysterious but not deceptive and was honestly one of the most original films I've seen in a long time. The only minor hiccups I had with the movie was 1) inaccuracies with aging characters. Barris was born in 1928, yet the scenes in the late 1970s and early 1980s he looks like he's still in his thirties! At least the movie was consistent in not aging any of the characters; and 2) I felt the pace dragged slightly at times. There were moments when I felt the momentum falter inexplicably and the opener was slightly slow as well.But those details are very minor and do not take away from the strength of this film. This is an engaging film, one that is intelligent and well-written, one that is acted superbly and crafted with such subtle craftsmanship from the best Hollywood has to offer. Great film! I'm surprised it doesn't get more credit8 out of 10!",8
279,Entertaining but about as reliable as getting your history lesson from your cat or someone with a severe head injury.,"As long as you realize that about half (or more) of what you see in this film is NOT true and it's a completely ridiculous and insane version of a real life celebrity's life, then by all means watch and enjoy it. It is NOT good history, as practically no one believes Chuck Barris' nutty 'autobiography' (in which he claims to have been a CIA assassin) and the writer and director of the film took no efforts to portray the rest of his life accurately. Despite the ever-present love interest in his life, Penny (Drew Barrymore), Barris never was married to a Penny...but had three other wives. And, often even the sequence of his TV shows isn't even close to being right, as the film shows him, while hosting ""The Gong Show"" (in the late 1970s) talking about another show he was thinking about making, ""Operation Entertainment""...even though this show aired about a decade earlier! So don't see it as any sort of lesson about Barris...none. If you can do that, the acting is quite nice (with a lot of high-profile actors making bit and larger appearances in the film) and the insane script is pretty interesting....at least until the very maudlin and dull ending.",6
280,Sam Rockwell's best acting manifestation,"I have no idea who Chuck Barry is, but I guess I should not miss Mr. Clooney's director debut, furthermore Charlie Kaufman is billed as the screen writer, so the premise looks rosy. The film kicks off with a self-inspective unreeling of Chuck's life-long hustle and bustle jostling with his TV show-runner identity and a clandestine CIA assassin, interspersing with black & white snippets of interviews with people who know Chuck in the real life (but mostly are pithy sound-bites whose only purpose is to mystify his personage), occasionally the film switches into an over-saturated, over-exposed hue which may engender some hallucinatory reverberation, since the most obvious selling point is the enthralling double life scenario and leaving all the traces which could be siphoned (by viewers) to make one's own judgment whether it is plain fictional or not. But the ramifications are as much ambiguous as what George Clooney (an exemplar of the mainstream Hollywood mindset) wants us to believe, it does manage to shape a believe-it- or-despise-it logjam and according to the film's depiction, Chuck Barry is nothing but a pipsqueak (there is no reference of any flair in his ascending in the show business), a lunatic has a very troubled mental state (a dreadful imagination of someone is going to finish him off), a repellent womanizer/sex-addict has big commitment issues if we simply remove the "" hit-man"" halo, so from which one could imply is that the ""other identity"" suits well to rationalize his personal mire, it is his last straw, but from the eyes of an audience, it flunks by blatantly over-beautifying the double-identity situation, I never feel the frisson albeit the film is being cunningly shot in a retro-redolent grain, with a friendly comic tone and lively interactions between the cinematography and the editing, plus an ace soundtrack with the trademark of its time. But pitifully Charlie Kaufman's script doesn't have too much to bite. The biographic nature demands a wider range of chronicle, which may also be the Achilles heel of the genre, without zooming in any enhanced center-pieces, everything runs episodic, leaving no instant aftertaste at all to be amazed and appreciated. All sidekicks are come-and- go (with Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts the female auxiliaries have longer stints, both equally awful I must say, Barrymore doesn't age at all along a two-decades span which is so dragging viewers out of the picture), the sole comic relief is the performance from Sam Rockwell, who was largely unknown at that time and overlooked by the awards season (a SILVER BERLIN BEAR for BEST ACTOR is his only trophy), his panache proffers the vitality of the film against its slightly mind-bogging narrative tempo, also his personal charisma transcends his character, and sublimates his character Chuck, a connection has been substantially built across the screen, a triumphant achievement in deed. Rutger Hauer, a fellow assassin, said in the film ""killing my first man (in the WWII) is like making love with my first woman"", which strikes a chord with my previous argument in DR. STRANGELOVE (1964, 8/10), war and killing may truly be the by-product of heterosexual men's hegemony in the society, if actually the raving stupidity germinates from the biologic impulse, along with evolution, let us hope a less macho but peaceful world is ahead of us.",6
281,Clooney has a promising future in film direction,"It should be absolutely awful. Who really wants to see a filmed version of the masturbational journals of an idiot like Chuck Barris? Actually, I'd forgive him for The Gong Show and the $1.98 Beauty Show. I've seen them both, and they're somewhat entertaining. I couldn't forgive him for writing such a pointless book as Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. So it is an enormous credit to George Clooney, making his directorial debut, that he keeps this film as good as it is throughout its entire run. I can't believe Charlie Kaufman could have written this alongside Being John Malkovich and Adaptation. It's a junky script desperately groping for profundity and/or sympathy for its lame central character. There are only a few moments of worthwhile humor. I especially like the annoying Dating Game contestant who wants Chuck to make the girl like him more. The acting is pretty good, too. Drew Barrymore, whom I don't care too much for, gives one of her best performances. I also liked Clooney himself, in an emotionless role that works well for him. Julia Roberts makes a nice visual impression, but the script didn't provide her character with any interest whatsoever. The cinematography is very beautiful, as well. But, like I said, the film belongs to Clooney and his stylish direction. Clooney often gets a bad rap for his acting, and, a lot of the time, I have to agree. So maybe he'll continue along this line and, with a better script, make a great film. 6/10.",6
282,Bizarre story based on the writings of Chuck Barris,"TV producer Chuck Barris has ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" in this 2002 movie directed by George Clooney and starring Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore, Julia Roberts and George Clooney with appearances by Dick Clark, Jaye P. Morgan, Brad Pitt and others. In Barris' writings, he claims that all the time he was developing and producing shows like ""The Newlywed Game,"" ""The Dating Game,"" and ""The Gong Show,"" he was moonlighting as a CIA hit man. He claims to have killed more than 100 people, though in the film he's credited with only 33.Done partially as a documentary, Barris' TV success is chronicled as is his love life with Penny (Barrymore); things get a little confusing when he gets drafted by the Clooney character and starts killing. Sometimes you're not sure if he's imagining an incident or if it really happened. Which is probably the point - no one knows whether or not these hit-man stories are really true.The film is rather coldly done and is about an unlikable character, and I have to admit I normally don't do well with this kind of film. Sam Rockwell is great as Barris, however, and Barrymore very effective and sweet as Penny.I haven't sufficiently researched this story, but there are some amusing things in it, and I would love to know whether or not they're true. One of the ways Barris claims to have been able to carry out these CIA hits is by sending the Dating Game and Newlywed Game winners to the location where the assassination is to take place - I mean, I would love to know if the show really sent people to West Berlin in winter! Also, Penny appears to be a fictional character or his real first wife with a fictional name. I wondered about that.After you see ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"" you'll be doing a lot of wondering.",6
283,GONG!!,"""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" -  from the pen of Chuck Barris about the life of Chuck Barris, t.v. producer/personality and self-alleged hitman for the CIA -  wanders haphazardly through a muddled mess of fact and fiction; a sort of Jack of all genres and master of none. The film doesn't work as drama or comedy or action or mystery or romance or...well, it just doesn't work. In spite  of the star power and talent along for this ride, ""Confessions..."" is not engaging, can't find its milieu, leaves us knowing less about the autobiographer than when it starts, and proves once again that actors, as a rule, should stick to acting and directors should stick to directing. I probably know a little more about Barris than the average Joe and watched with interest on the wane in spite of that. Maybe the film will play better for those who don't remember the man or his persona. Sorry, Chuckie..GONG! (B-)",6
284,A weird mind,"Watching this film, I couldn't help recalling another one, ""A Beautiful Mind"", the story of another troubled soul that parallels, in a way, the life of the main character of this one: Chuck Barris.It's a big stretch of the imagination to imagine the real Barris as a CIA operative, let alone, someone worth of a biopic with a screen play by Charlie Kaufman and an interesting directorial debut by George Clooney. What Mr. Kaufman seems to be doing is trying to make sense of a life that otherwise would not merit a minute of screen time.The acting is excellent. The biggest surprise was Julia Roberts, who shows a range we haven't seen in her many forgettable movies. In the film she makes her character come alive. Also, Drew Barrymore is quite good as the girl who loves Barris unconditionally. Of course, the film belongs to Sam Rockwell, an extraordinary actor who does great work with the material he is given. Mr. Rockwell is an interesting actor to watch. Also good, the director, George Clooney, who as the recruiter, gives a mysterious reading on the man who has enough power to get rid of enemies through his manipulation of weak individuals.This film is will infuriate and bore viewers since the narrative is quite uneven. Also, it will elate fans of Charlie Kaufman, who keeps getting better and better as he keeps climbing to the top of his profession.",6
285,Brilliantly Pace-Setting,"25 January 2003. Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is a gorgeous, well photographed, well acted, brilliant movie that brings together movie basic movie elements well.The directing, the cinematography, the lighting, the entire techniques used in this movie capture a new level, a new pathbreaking step towards movie-making, much like Jaws did back in 1975. While not as popular nor as profitable as Jaws, Confessions encompasses a synthesis of great movie-making elements and packages them into an excellent movie for the cerebral and the critical film-going public. Julia Roberts has been cast into a great out of her box role. Sam Rockwell captures Chuck Barris movements and idiosyncracies and George Clooney continues his obsession with the full backside nudity of the male body this time as a director in this movie and as an actor in Solaris. This schizophrenic movie with a twist is full of humor and drama, of character-driven scenes with carefully planned uses of light and shadow, actual interviews intercutting. This is a serious and successful effort by a first-time director. With enchanting performances by Rockwell, Julia, Clooney, and Drew Barrymore.",9
286,Better Than Average Offbeat Comedy - Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,"A lot of people don't get this film. They think it is for real; that Clooney and Roberts are playing straight roles. They think that Barris was actually in the CIA. A more realistic title for this film would have been ""Fantasies of a Sick Mind""; because it is fairly obvious to even a college psychology student that Barris had several disorders. Sam Rockwell does his level best to make us believe Barris led two lives; but he didnt. He just hated the life he was leading. He hated himself more than anyone else; possibly because he thought all he ever created for TV was drek. But he was being unfair to himself. He entertained millions for many years with at least three of his hit shows. One philosopher once said that making people laugh was more important than writing a best-selling novel. This comedy has some problems, however. It is difficult to laugh at a man who has been kicked down on the ground, which is pretty much what Barris did to himself. His CIA fantasies were an outlet for his frustrations in real life. I am sure he wanted to kill several executives at NBC for not giving his original show a shot. He wanted to kill himself at some level as well, and sabotaged his personal relationship with Penny at every turn possible because he felt he didnt deserve her. But, to his credit, he eventually overcame his morbid impulses and did the right thing. Its hard to make a comedy out of that situation, but the situation was so absurd, that it became a very good absurdist comedy; a bit like Terry Gilliam. Clooney is hilarious as a CIA hit man and Roberts was very funny as well. But what I enjoyed the most was Matt Damon's hair style on the Dating Game.",6
287,"The Weird Story of Chuck Barry, in an Excellent Debut of George Clooney as Director","Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) is a weird but very intelligent man, full of creative ideas of different and commercial game shows for the new type of entertainment in America, the television business. He is very frustrated in love, but when he meets Penny (Drew Barrymore), he loves her in his unconventional way, having  an open relationship. Chuck is invited by Jim Byrd (George Clooney) to be a special agent hired by CIA to work as a killer. While performing his missions as a hitman, using the TV show as a cover for his secret activities, he knows Patricia `Trish' Watson (Julia Roberts), who gives the targets of his missions. This weird and very unconventional story very related to the American culture introduces George Clooney as a director. His debut could not be better, very well supported by the outstanding screenplay of Charlie Kaufman and having Steven Soderbergh as the producer. `Confessions of a Dangerous Mind' is a stylish and different movie, which sometimes recalls the Cohen brothers style, having a wonderful photography, excellent actors and actresses, inclusive with minor participation of very famous persons. The incredible story of Chuck Barris is an excellent entertainment. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): `Confissões de uma Mente Perigosa' (`Confessions of a Dangerous Mind')",9
288,Different,"**HERE BE SPOILERS**Chuck Barris (Rockwell) is a man struggling to get in the TV show-business. His idea for a show doesn't get aired and he is short of money. He is approached by Jim Byrd (Clooney) and offered the job as an agent. Needing money he accepts. But then his life get complicated. He has an peculiar relationship with the love of his life, Penny (Barrymore), his shows get aired, he becomes very successful and he travels around the world murdering people.Obviously, this man is living two separate lives. One as a TV-producer and one as a hit-man. It is funny to see that the movie actually keeps these story lines separate, until he personally get difficulties to separate them. Barris is no ordinary man, and the situations he gets into and actions he makes is odd resulting in a peculiar story. It might be hard for a movie to show an coherent understandable story when it is peculiar as this, but CoDM actually succeed fairly well. I must say, the suspense is low, and to me is put into a secondary role. The main part is just to see the world from the viewpoint of this very strange man.So, the movie is peculiar and different. Entertaining but not the greatest I ever seen.6/10",6
289,Quick review,"Turns out I was in the mood for Confessions of a dangerous mind all along.Sam Rockwell well is great as Chuck Barris a extremely damaged man. I went into this film blind and was very pleasantly surprised, this is a funny but also kind of depressing biography of a man who like most of us, just didn't know who he was.Definitely check this one out.",7
290,"Cheeky, that's about it...","Chuck Barris, who became a television icon in the mid-1970s while acting as producer-creator-host of TV's ""The Gong Show"", has his humble and strange beginnings reenacted by first-time director George Clooney, who curiously displays a loving affection for innocent American nostalgia and yet a puny breadth of imagination behind the camera. Clooney's set-ups for each scene are in joshing good humor, spiked by fantasy visuals that give the project a light, jovial mood, but--aside from an amusing camera-shot peering through a cut-out shape of the United States and a tricky bit involving Julia Roberts and two coffee cups--nothing from Clooney shows much originality or chutzpah (the handling of the picture is as canned as a TV laugh-track). The performances are intentionally overscaled, which doesn't help us get a good grip on the personal drama that frames the film. This was a life story no one really wanted to see adapted to the screen, and not even Clooney (as both director and supporting actor, playing the CIA operative who recruits Barris) can muster up much excitement. *1/2 from ****",4
291,Barris is as imaginative as he is weird.,"Chuck Barris knows what sells, and he gives it to you. I don't for one second buy that he was a CIA agent recruited by the CIA. But, it does make for a much better story than his real life story. The ""spy"" sequences of this movie resemble every cheesy spy novel or movie that was ever put out. And it looks like Barris has seen and read all of these cheezy movies in order to form his ""memories"". If you pay attention, you'll notice that the cameo by the real unknown comic actually serves to lay down the premise that this was all a Barris fantasy. After all, if someone had pulled a gun on you and pointed it straight at your head, you'd figure that your ONE big memory of that person would be that event. But the best they could get out of the unknown comic for this film was ""I never saw that side, but a lot of the crew thought that he could turn on them"". That doesn't sound exactly like the declaration one would make in a film that purports to reveal the ""truth"". Putting all this aside, as a movie, I thought it was alright. Lots of twists and turns, not on the dark side at all, as some have commented. It's a look inside the ramblings of a sick delusional mind, which I found entertaining and different.",8
292,Excellent movie,"Chuck Barris is a successful TV producer and presenter. Behind this façade lurks a secret - he is a CIA assassin.George Clooney's directorial debut, and it's a great one. (Also worth noting that the screenplay was written by Charlie Kaufman, of Being John Malkovich, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Adaptation fame). Excellent movie, mixing humour and drama. Plot is superb - you're kept guessing at what is real and what is not, and where it all will lead. The movie, however, is made by the acting of Sam Rockwell. His performance is mind-blowingly brilliant.",9
293,"The ""advantages"" of globalization.","People say that reality overpasses fiction in all aspects. This movie, based in a true history, has the ability to reflect poverty and human degradation from a social and political perspective. Under what circumstances a woman becomes a prostitute? This history is one crude answer. Eastern Europe is suffering the effects of globalization and common population is paying a very high cost.Maria, the name of the main character, is a common woman, married with a worker who used to be a working class hero. Because the acquisition from an American company, her husband lost his job and then misery starts. Social problems like alcoholism, gambling, family violence and prostitution are reflected with severity and even with humor. Director (Netzer) solved the plot very skillfully: present the situation as a reflect of an economical situation, not a moral or ethics issues. All problems are money related and its absence causes the overturning situations.In a very beautiful sequence, María is in her house with her seven children. All of them are sleeping and she starts looking at the mirror. The oldest girl is looking at her. María opens her blouse and folds her skirt. She starts to look at her self as a prostitute, she decided in that exactly point to become one. Then, in another later sequence the oldest girl do exactly the same in front the mirror. Always is a crossing point and Netzer built the moment in a poetic way. Other excellent sequences occur when María is in front of the TV. The first time to see the results of a riot at the government palace (with a crude scene of a man lighting fire to him self), the second time watching her self when two prostitutes passed by and finally when her history is told to Rumania by the TV, when she realizes her present and probably her future. I liked the movie a lot and strongly recommend the audience to see it. Not everything in the plot is crude scenes and tears. Netzer includes a perfect character (Ion) to make us laugh and created perfect situations to combine drama with comedy. No matter if the history took place in Rumania, could be applicable everywhere and we could find Marías in every city where poverty is real and overpasses the fiction by far. This is the kind of histories than make us think and consider other people's situations, the kind of movies that could shake our consciences and aware us about the ""advantages"" of the globalization. A must see movie.",9
294,"Sad, but true...","Maria is the best rumanian movie I've ever seen, and it's not that I haven't seen a lot. Maria is a film about a young woman, who is having serious problems with her husband. Not to mention her 7 kids... She has to fight hard for every piece of bread, so that her family don't die in misery.It's true, the movie isn't easy to watch. I think I've seen a lot of stuff like this, but the character of Maria is getting me so tight for the throat, that I can't stop the tears. Like I said - sad but true, because the movie is based on a true story. I won't tell you more details about the plot, you'll have to see it for yourself, it's worth, I guarantee.Don't expect a boring movie. I still remember some scenes, some close-ups, some persons (they are ALL so typical for our time, for Rumania and it's problems of today, you won't never forget the fat dutch woman, talking some strange bad version of english), Maria.But first of all, Maria is a beautiful picture. For me it's very similar to Tornatore's ""MALENA"". If you think (like me) MALENA is the most beautiful movie, MARIA is a must see for you.Thank God, there's still more good directors with their warm, human, beauty pieces... Believe me, MARIA is one of those pieces...",10
295,A true story in more ways than one,"The story of Maria, the impoverished wife of a factory worker with seven kids, is based on a true story. However, after watching the film, I felt that I had seen the story of millions of women throughout the post-communist world and elsewhere wherever urban poverty exists. The details are crystal clear, the obstacles scorchingly real, but the overarching struggle, to put food on the table for her seven children, is the story that involves the viewer.Besides that, we see the husband and his best friend, a sort of Sancho Panza type, as they stumble their way through life, irresponsibly leaving their families to drink, gamble and drift away. The husband is an enigma, being reduced to yet another obstacle in Maria's life. I think the film would have much more depth if we could understand the husband a bit better. He represents the other side of urban, post-industrial society, the loss of a role for the unemployed father.In all, it is a beautifully written story, with some excellent acting from all the main cast. A truly worthwhile film to see.",8
296,sad yet funny,"first off i would like to say that i never liked romanian movies..but this one made me realize that i could be missing a lot. I was shocked so to say. It is basically a romanian tale which appeared on the screen with the help of a romanian vision.The story is sad but yet funny by it's tragedy. One woman corrupted by society to sell herself so she can take care of her children.I'm glad that romanian movies appear on IMDb, and i hope as many of you can watch them. Maria really makes you think about the reality around us.",8
297,Mama ! An universal word !,"Yes this movie can be compared to many : SOPHIE'S CHOICE , MALENA , MAMA ROMA.......etc.The subject is universal and atemporal : How far will go a mother to save his child (her children) , to provide for him(them) ? A mother's love can be measured in those difficult moments of life . I liked particularly one moment in the movie when Ion ask that his children to eat first and then later he will have the dinner , this man animalized , despicable for some he puts the children first , that shows there is some humanity left in him.Also Ion is the result of a decadent society , where supposedly we are free , we are allowed to protest , even we can torch ourselves . Who cares ? Ion is losing his job , then the rest is just domino principle , snowball or whatever you wanna call it ,a series of violence , alcohol , gambling.But Maria is got a strong character , like Atlas with a huge globe on his back she is taking the responsibilities of feeding a large family , despite misery.",10
298,Life without make-up,"Irony, sadness, misery, shattered dreams... ""Maria"" has it all. It is not a movie about succeeding in life, it is a movie about surviving. The movie depicts the story of a young woman trying to get through the harsh world of the suburbs. Mother of seven children, Maria tries her utmost to ensure a decent life for her family. Without any support from her husband, and after every one has tried to take advantage of her, she faces the terrible truth: her only chance is to sell her body. Watching the movie, I kept asking myself: ""What will happen to save Maria? Which is the element that is supposed to save the day?"" Then I realized that there is no answer to my question.",9
299,a surreal version of an uncommon life,"I did watch this film in it's premiere in Athens, at the festival of Franchophone films.I liked the movie which incorporated many surreal and fantasy elements in the linear narrative of the life of the hero. He had an alter ego, which was the substantiation of a childhood fantasy which always tried to tempt him to follow the broad path that led to riches, fame, sex and power. He followed the advice of his evil other self and he became the public icon we know from history and the media. Emphasis is also given to his Jewishness and his courage to manifest it before collaborationist authorities as a young boy.Excepting the marked surreal elements which the director in an introductory speech attributed to the fact that he is also a comic strip creator, the film emphasizes what we already know, that is his incessant womanizing, publicity seeking and studied provocative stance, culminating in his memorable if controversial rendering of the Marselleise-the French national anthem-in a reggae music version and a refrain that was full of irony. The sometimes overemphasized description of his rampant sexuality drove some of the audience out of the theatre as did the depiction of his reggae version of the French national anthem. But this was obviously an overreaction due either to ignorance or desire to cut a figure. If you had the slightest idea of who Gainsbourgh was, you would not be expecting anything else from a movie dedicated to his life story.Because Gainsbough was prone to the pleasures of the flesh with women famous or ordinary, many impressive actresses such as Laetitia Casta and Anna Muglalis appear in the movie portraying the gorgeous women he had affairs with. The whole impression you form is that he had been a anti-authoritarian bobo(bourgeois-Boheme) before this term had been invented.There is also a sensitive depiction of his relationship with his parents, which was closer and more intimate than one would expect from a man who had such an obvious (real or affected) grudge towards authority.The actresses play convincingly the women of his life, who were glamorous and sexy. In the end one is left with the question whether such a life is enviable and worthy of emulation or example to avoid. whichever answer each one reaches, as a spectacle it is surely interesting to see.",7
300,"It's not big or clever to smoke, and it doesn't make you look cool  unless you happen to be Serge Gainsbourg  !","GAINSBOURG (Vie héroïque)  from the Studio Canal stable depicts the life story of Serge Gainsbourg from early childhood in the 1930's and 40's, until just before his death in 1991.Born Lucien Ginsburg – and as an impressionable youth he felt outcast as being a Jewish child in Nazi occupied Paris in the 1940's – leading him to develop an imaginary friend who adopted an increasingly grotesque caricature / persona of himself that would lead him on to do more and more outrageous things to ""rebel"" his situation and to attempt to gain an element of ""love"" and ""acceptance"" from his notoriety.A talented musician and artist, Lucien (who later was persuaded by friends to change his name to the more ""acceptable"" Serge Gainsbourg) became the darling of the social scene, charming his way through a succession of affairs with beautiful women – most notably Brigitte Bardot, Juliette Greco, and Jane Birkin.I'm surprised that they didn't have a cigarette company sponsoring this movie – as the sheer amount of fags smoked during this film must be some sort of record! After the showing of the film (at the Cineworld, Haymarket, London) we were treated to a Question and Answer session with the Writer / Director of this movie JOANN SFAR, who explained that the idea for the film came from his own graphic novel on Serge Gainsbourg penned by JOANN SFAR – and this pretty much formed the construct and ambiance of the movie – it is highly graphical and visual in it's content – much of it being fantasy visions and flashbacks within Gainsbourg's mind. Talking from the heart – Joann showed a real passion for the film, and was very open as to how the film was created.Gainsbourg became the darling of French society with his talent and flair – but he also would court scandal and became infamous for the release of ""Je t'aime... moi non plus"" (which he originally wrote for Bardot) and the seemingly disrespectful reggae version of the French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"", but love him or loath him – you couldn't ignore him ..The whole movie is very atmospheric, and some of the casting of this film was inspired – especially the terrific performances by Eric Elmosnini in the title role, the stunning beautiful Laetitia Casta as Brigitte Bardot, Lucy Gordon as Jane Birkin, Anna Mouglalis as Juliette Greco and Kacey Mottet Klein as the young Lucien Ginsburg.At the end credits of the film is a dedication ""to Lucy"" which referred to the actress Lucy Gordon – who (the director explained) played the part of Jane Birkin in the film – and who had tragically committed suicide during the final editing parts of the film – a talented actress – and a sad loss.At 2 hours 10mins long, in French with English subtitles GAINSBOURG will not be everyone's cup of tea  but the film DOES keep you entertained and if you give it a chance, I'm sure that you will not be disappointed ...It's not big or clever to smoke, and it doesn't make you look cool  unless you happen to be Serge Gainsbourg  ! GAINSBOURG is on general release from 30th July 2010",8
301,a complex work about France in the 20th century and about one of its major artists,"Where does this amazing film come from? Who is Joann Sfar, a director I never heard about before? The easiest answer at hand was the wikipedia entry which tells us that Sfar is a well known comics author in the fabulous French-Belgian tradition. He is of Jewish origin, and his next film is an adaptation of one of his comics successes called The Rabbi's Cat.And suddenly all makes sense. The opening scenes of the film contain the key of the biography of French musician and poet Serge Gainsbourg as imagined by Sfar. We see Lucien Ginzburg, a Jewish kid in occupied Paris during WWII daring not only to laugh in fronde at the nose of the collaborationist police by being the first in line to receive his yellow Star of David as a sign of nobility rather than an anathema, but moreover, to transform in his mind and his sketch drawings the fat rapacious Jew on the Vichy posters in the thin, stylish, long nose and big years Gueule - the alter-ego who will guide his steps and feed his revenging self-confidence for the rest of his life.The combination of acting and cartoon is not a new thing, but it has never been tried before in a biopic to the best of my knowledge. Sure, it is not the usual respectful biopic but it's the vision of Sfar about Ginzburg - Gainsbourg, and Sfar he says in the final text before the credits was more interested about Gainsbourg lies than by his perceived truths. Moreover, for sure Gainsbourg himself would not have appreciated a respectful film. Ironically under-titled 'Vie heroique' (heroic life) the film takes us though the artistic and especially womanizing career of Gainsbourg from the early 50s to the late 70s. We see him in the company of such French cultural icon as Boris Vian and especially of fabulous women such as Juliette Greco, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin (and actually the list in the film is very partial). I enjoyed each of the scenes in this part of the film which combine style, attention to details (just follow how fashion changes marking the progress of time) and deep understanding of the atmosphere of the Parisian clubs and artistic milieu in the mythic mid-20 century. His Gueule alter-ego mentors him though this trip and when he decides to renounce his patronizing, it's the beginning of the end - the charisma goes away and the effects of his excesses slowly destroy him. Maybe a little more of his art would have provided an even more complex and balanced image of the person that Gainsbourg was - this would be my only observation.The choice of Eric Elmosnino as Gainsbourg is excellent, he drives the character from the insecurity of the young age to the decay of the end, all the time with charm and deep empathy. He proves a perfect understanding of the intentions of the director and a full identification with the identity dilemmas of the French-Jewish Gainsbourg. Laetitia Casta is a perfect replica of Bardot. Lucy Gordon is mastering very well Jane Birkin's role. Her maturity makes even harder to explain the suicide of the young actress a few days before the film was presented in avant-premiere at Cannes.",9
302,Not what we were led to believe it was.,"Diane and I had much the same opinion of this film: we thought that it was far too mannered for our taste and that the substance of this man's life could have been presented, directionally, more staid. During the film I kept thinking of Baz Luhmann's Moulin Rouge, another movie that was too mannered. It just goes to show how much people's taste varies because I sat through the movie and left wondering what I had seen; what was all the fuss about? I did not find out much of substance about the guy or his background or sequential events in his life. As a viewer, if you are looking for a minor biographical look at this man's life then buy a book. If on the other hand you don't mind seeing a Picassoesque rendering of Serge Gainsbourg's life then this movie is for you—enjoy!",2
303,Serge Gainsbourg. The Man. The Myth. The Legend?,"Lucien 'Serge Gainsbourg' Ginsburg. Artist. Writer. Performer. Alcoholic. Smoker. Rebel. Womanizer. Genius? Joann Sfar's film documents the sporadic lifestyle of the famous French artist Serge Gainsbourg (Eric Elmosnino), whose life contained no boundaries, no objects off limit, and continually tested the patience of those huddled together around him. Beginning with a young Gainsbourg developing his taste for painting aspiring models in Nazi-Occupied France as a mere teenager, the film thereupon concentrates primarily upon his relationships with various beautiful women and his life choices in regards to his ever-changing occupation over his sixty-year-life-span.What makes this film work so well as a biopic is the truly ingenious performances by both Kacey Mottet Klein (Young Gainsbourg) and Eric Elmosnino (Adult Gainsbourg) who both somewhat beautifully represent such a tragic figure throughout his whole on-screen lifetime. Kacey portrays Gainsbourg as a boy who is maturing faster than those other children around him, so far so, that he explains to one of the schoolchildren the reason that he is good at drawing pubic hairs is because he has had an up-close and personal experience with them before. While he is also shown to be a lonely child, an outcast as Jewish child growing up in Nazi-Occupied France, and thus he develops an affable 'imaginary friend' to keep himself company. Born as small, soft head that watches over young Gainsbourg as he sleeps in the woods to avoid the Nazi soldiers, his only friend soon becomes his worst enemy as he matures into a complicated man. His once pleasant 'imaginary friend' is now a grotesque being with a large nose, long-thin fingers and an affection for cigarettes and bullying Gainsbourg. He continually berates insults, prods and engages Serge, providing the viewpoint that he himself was his harshest critic, and a critic he could not simply dismiss without entire control over his life.Aside from the performances, the way Sfar allows the films narrative to flow in a temporal manner with no mention of time, or calendar dates, further draws the audience in to Gainsbourg's contrived world. The only way to tell when an event shifts forward in his lifetime, is through his own physical deterioration from old age which is heavily dictated by his excessive abuse of alcohol and tobacco. But as Gainsbourg becomes older, his sexual conquests stay the same age; from Elisabeth (Deborah Grall), to Jane (the late Lucy Gordon), and to an affair with the insatiable Brigitte Bardot (Laetitia Casta), before he eventually settles down with Bambou (Mylene Jampanoi), who would be his final partner. These are all young, vulnerable women who Gainsbourg exploits for his own sexual misgivings, and once they become too old, or too boring, he discards them like a child throwing away an old toy to badger his parents for a new, more expensive model.Joann Sfar beautifully flowing biopic paints Serge Gainsbourg as a shallow, misogynistic, grumpy old man, who once had dreams of becoming famous for doing anything, but once those dreams were realised, greed and narcissism triumphed over his once forgotten ambitions. Utilizing his gift for writing, artistry and music Gainsbourg chose the route of controversy and scandal over that of happiness and family, which is exemplified in his response to the media after he had a heart attack. When the reporters asked what he will be doing now after such a dangerous and life threatening operation, Gainsbourg calmly asserted to those in attendance that he will ""continue to smoke many more cigarettes and drink much more alcohol.""",8
304,A little disappointing,"Serge Gainsbourg was many things: an artist, writer, painter, alcoholic and lover to many. He is a fascinating man who lead a fascinating life and director Joann Sfar makes a great effort here to portray it all. From the early days prior to WWII Gainsbourg was clearly going to amount to something. As he grew older and dabbled here and there in various art forms and dabbled in various women with lovers including Bridgette Bardot and Jane Birkin. Yet as he grew older Gainsbourg dabbled in more drink and drugs and this led to a troubled life.I was to begin with fascinated by this man, full of charm and wit and ideas abounding. Yet as the film progressed I felt less and less concerned by this man and began wondering when the film might end. As interesting he was, he was also not the nicest of characters, especially in his latter years when he appears to be a drunk and grumpy man. The little touches of fantasy work well to begin with, Gainsbourg's 'imaginary friend' is interesting, but then becomes more and more grotesque and yet more annoying and often blurs the line between realism and surrealism.Ultimately this has enough to provide an interesting account of someone who had a very full life, but for me it lost it's way part way through and therefore lost it's momentum.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",6
305,"This is a lively and inventive bio-pic, if a little over long .","This is a film that makes no bones about the ultimate squandering of Serge Gainsbourg's talents in a drink - induced decline but at the same time shows the creative and cultural force that his very surname still brings to mind for most French people . The movie brings out particularly well the smoky atmosphere of jazz clubs and gigs where the young Serge first plied his musicality in the 1950s. The phases of his life, from young Jewish boy in occupied France through his creative life and personal life ( for instance )amours with such as Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin in the 1960s are dizzily but effectively handled . There is some attempt by Director Sfar to portray Gainsbourg , in late career , as something of an anti- intolerance man of principle but the overall impression given is of an imaginative , somewhat amoral figure whose life was ultimately an example of artistic decline and hedonistic self-indulgence . The film is rather long but, overall , sustains interest well . The main roles are all played well by the actors ,including the female leads Laetitia Casta and the late Lucy Gordon , and the cartoon - like features of the movie , such as Serge's giant alter-ego , impressionistically contribute something positive to the story . Viewers from Anglophone countries who will best remember Gainsbourg as the singing half of the 1969 heavy- breathing pop hit "" Je t'aime moi non plus "" may still leave the cinema wondering what really was the artistic importance of Serge . Yet they will nonetheless , on the strength of this bio-pic , carry away an image of the principal character as an unforgettable personality .French people , on the other hand , who already regard him as a cultural icon and , in their terms ,as a genius will not need this movie to make up their minds about Serge Gainsbourg .",4
306,"A flamboyant work, a real pleasure to your eyes, but still a little bit plain.","A film, concentrating on the personality of the composer-singer. An icon of twentieth century, not only for France, but to whole Europe, perhaps even to the whole Occidental world. Basically, this work of Joann Sfar is based onto the the most remarkable points of Gainsbourg's life, and that is, oh, so comprehensible, because otherwise we'd have a film of five hours or more, nevertheless the two hours and twenty minutes seem already sufficient. And maybe even more than that. This interpretation of Serge Gainsbourgs' life is a work of flaming colors; of ambiances which change periodically with the passage of time, ups and downs of Serge's life. At the end, regarding on all the milieus seen, we realize not only the length of the film, but as well the rapid cultural changes in France of twentieth century.Pursuing on that, Sfar starts leading the spectator on a guided tour called ''Serge's life''. It starts from the forties when France was bearing the heavy weight of German occupation – this is where Russian Jewish boy called Lucien Ginsburg grows up. Though, it is funny, that in this part of movie, we can find all the stereotypes of France, in particularly Paris, for which the rest of the world keeps going mad even nowadays. Let's see, here we have the artistic ambiances of Monmartre, very similar to those of Belle Époque, bohemian to the bone - the cozy cafés, femmes fatales, chanson française and so on... This movie couldn't be seen as a real biography, starting already with the small phantasms in a form of giant head of a Jewish man who comes out of a Nazi poster to play and dance with little Lucien. It is the same boy, who later imagines La Gueule, a caricatured idol of himself in the childhood, but a big, fat ego and an exteriorized inner voice, during the adult life. Already as a kid, he is a real charmer, an artist with multiple talents, seducing everyone around him. With the time passing this capacity of seduction becomes more and more sexual. It grows in geometrical progression until we meet (very intimately) Brigitte Bardot, the sex symbol of the time. We possibly couldn't denie that Laetitia Casta not only resembles very much to the authentic goddess of the time. She does give some quite authentic elements of Bardot's performance in Vadim's Et Dieu Créa La Femme. When dating Brigitte Bardot, Lucien Ginsbourg is already long gone, it's now the eccentric, successful and famous Serge Gainsbourg. The self convinced type, always with a cigarette in the corner of his lips. Sfar realizes very well, that the ""best-seller"" of the Gainsbourg appearances is his profile view, which, no-one in nowadays' Europe would never mistake. Perhaps, it is also that the man who plays Gainsbourg. Eric Elmosnino, from this point of view does not look like himself, but like his portrayed character. Stunning resemblance! And we can find a short reference to Antonioni's Blow-Up. It is the iconic image of Jane Birkin, wearing nothing but bright colored stockings.Being this far, it is not difficult to see that the main leading powers of Gainsbourg's fame were... his talent and the charming trouble makers' appearances. Sfar's film has depicted them both. More, the presence of the phantasms and loud spoken dialogs with his inner him – La Gueule, points at the will to make this movie a bit different from a simple telling of a biography (assuming, that a large number already knows it). But still, I'd like to say that it is not enough to make this film a real masterpiece. The linearity is a little bit boring, and after the first half of the movie has been seen, you might want to check your watch. This is an unstoppable rolling towards the end, the only limit of the man – the end. But cinema has such wonderful possibilities to play with reality and even time, so why could we not have a little bit more interesting way of telling this exciting story? This makes the movie a bit plain, even with such wonderful and detailed work on visual elements.The music? I guess it is inutile to say what kind and whose music we hear in the film. The relations between the music and images are well done, they illustrate time and place and whispers how Serge is doing. Whether you like it or not, it is already another question...",6
307,Gainsbourg: Portrait of an Insecure Icon,"Based on a graphic novel by the director (Joann Sfar), 'Gainsbourg' charts the tumultuous life of Lucien Ginsberg, the precocious son of Russian-born Jews (who settled in Paris at the time of Germany's occupation of France), who gained fame and notoriety for his music, muses and mercurialness.Played with remarkable confidence by Kacey Mottet Klein, the young Ginsburg passes through school smoking and drawing lewd pictures of the female models he adores, and intellectually evading Nazi wrath (he pretends he is friends with Goebbles to avoid wearing the yellow star).His skill as a lyricist and pianist is recognised and he is given his new persona: Serge Gainsbourg (Eric Elmosnino). His fame quickly skyrockets as does his appeal to famous ladies of the 1960s: Brigitte Bardot (a sultry Laetitia Casta), the bohemian Juliette Gréco (Anna Mouglalis, fresh from her role as Coco Chanel) and the English singer/actress, Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon, who tragically committed suicide before the film's release).At various points in the film Gainsbourg is joined by La Gueule ('The Mug'), his alter ego and everything he is not: daring, debonair, devil-may-care. Although I was intrigued by this peculiar, gangly figure, whose ears are emphasised and whose nose is ridiculously long and aquiline (a reference to Ginsberg's insecurity), the surrealism of this character seemed to detract from Elmosnino's performance and therefore quickly seemed bathetic. This is Sfar's first stab as a director, so he was bound to make dubious judgements. The biggest one was casting Elmosnino as the lead. The part is too big for him. There's a very claustrophobic atmosphere and interiors are generally only partly shown, which is perhaps a reflection of Gainsbourg's insularity.When I read about how influential Serge Gainsbourg was, how many genres he experimented with and what inspired him to pen and feature in the famously lascivious song, 'Je t'aime moi non plus' ('I love you... me neither'), I thought I was in for a real treat. Watch this film and you may come away thinking the man was nothing but a self-effacing, odd- looking, quasi-talented musician who was prone to unexpected blubbering and who was liked, bizarrely, for those qualities which he himself was insecure about.www.scottishreview.net",5
308,Lowlife bohemia collides with 50's Hollywood,"The life story of Serge Gainsbourg had to be filmed, and as he's one of the famous Frenchmen who aren't in fact Belgian, it's only a surprise that it took so long. That his life spanned the Nazi occupation to the rise of Disco would stretch credibility if this were fiction, but as it's all more or less true the director, who is already an accomplished graphic artist, manages to lift it to the level of slightly absurd fiction. Mixing in animation, self-consciously stagey sets and a life-sized puppet as Gainsbourg's dreaded alter ego.Even the sordid lowlife is given the big treatment, and the early days in the garret look unashamedly glamorous as they would if re-imagined for an opera set or a Salvador Dali dream sequence, as director Joann Sfar lays it on with a trowel. The episodic nature of the story gives it a rather patchy feel though, and I couldn't help thinking that one or two episodes, especially the cute Hollywood-style musical scene with Brigitte Bardot, could have been shorter. Bardot was just one of the high-profile women Gainsbourg captured, and so was the muse of the existentialists, Juliette Greco.The casting is pretty uncanny with the possible exception of Greco, who was never that model-thin. Gainsbourg has always been, at least outside France, more famous for being cool than for his music. But his reworking of La Marseillaise which so upset the rightwing patriots of the Seventies was nothing but excellent. I'll go back just to hear that Sly and Robbie riddim one more time.Quite a substantial feast but it's worth building up an appetite in advance. And of course, you get Jane Birkin and... That Song.",8
309,Biopic that sort of works,"As an Englishman I didn't have as much of an idea of Serge Gs career as most of the previous critics here, so a lot of this film was pretty educational. However, it wasn't a literal biopic by any means, using the cartoon characters alongside Serge (quite well, I thought) and the latter half of his life (I didn't realise when or whether he'd died until I'd read one of your reviewers!) seemed to tail off into nothing, even more than his increasing physical degradation was suggesting.I found the emphasis on his sexual groundbreaking and role as a general iconoclast a bit similar to the film ""Mesrine"" which came out a year or two back - a similar time period was covered in that - masses of smoke and sexism! The actresses playing Jane Birkin and Juliette Greco are good (especially Jane Bs English/French accent) but ""Brigitte Bardot"" less so, and the scenes with her do go on a bit (although some of the poses are meant to correspond with real Bardot roles like ""Et Dieu Crea La Femme"" and ""La Mepris"".The music fits in well with the film and, surprisingly - with the film making style - the intrusion of early 1960s loud pop, and of reggae, is quite a shock to the system, as it is intended to be, and was at the time. Perhaps I'm missing some of the French references, but in general the milieu Gainsbourg moved in might not be best served by a ""straight"" biopic with a Nicholas Cage-type performance, but the surrealist cartoons do detract from the picture we get of Serge - and believe me, it's not that easy to like him! I wasn't that keen on the precocious young boy stage of his life either - a bit too ""that's the French way boys grow up"" all very pre-Simone de Beauvoir.Anyway shouldn't carp too long - I was glad I saw it and a lot will stay with me, although I'll remember the Django-type guitar playing possibly longer than the (apparently rather few) Gainsbourg songs which graced the soundtrack.",7
310,I liked the reference to post-war cultural development,"###### Might contain spoilers ######### I personally found the portrayal of decay one of the most impressive features in the movie. The character's fall naturally depicts the transition of the haute-couture from the war-years, which was yet a reminiscence of Golden Era, yet with a little less social exclusion, towards the chaotic and disturbing culture the re-building process in the post-war years.You can see it first in the transition of the protagonist's manners, which change from subliminally provocative in childhood towards openly ironic during the time spent with Brigitte Bardot - every attempt to remain sincere and ""ernst"" during this time must have been felt as a facre - , towards unreflected vulgar anti-everything proclamations you see in the re-make of the sex-driven song and the years after.Also, you can see it in the changing clothing, which slowly progresses and finally finds its point of no return when Gainsborg finds his British wife. First of all, it's the inter-national coupling, which of course introduces compromises on all sides, and which also makes him send away his visage, which is basically a symbol of his genius overall. What he sends away is the normed cultural knowledge he gained as an aspiring French intellectual. Accepting to embrace the then more inter-national culture, he becomes basically a perverse anti-hero which resembles the Proustian portray of Bloch. While he learns and transcends the inter-disciplinary approach towards the new culture, he becomes a torn-apart individual and ultimately an outsider for both the French and the British society, in which he lives, becoming truly an international cultural outlaw. (The first hint at his outlaw status is the rejection of his song written for Brigitte) So, his clothes change towards what you would think a typical drug-addicted rock-n-roll star outfit and has not the slightest scent of culture and style left. He resembles a little bit the latest pictures found on Dylan.But most interestingly is the attempt to relate this final breakdown with the his experience of WW2, something that is dominantly present in the scenes where he performs the Marseillese. You see that subconsciously, he still is haunted by his past, and while his embracement of earlier haute-couture allowed him to feel at home and at peace somehow with his country and intellectual background, the emergence of a new form of pop culture - loud clubs where electronic music is played, an Asian looking girl friend, a ton of Garbage art on his estate -, you can see that this last piece of hope and divinity, which he found in the art of chanson writing, falls apart and leaves him with nothing left than ruins.The entire biopic hence deals somehow with the cultural breakdown of the entire society due to the rebuilding process of post-war Europe, and the massive dilution of cultural products across borders, and the end of self-consciousness it introduces with itself.The last dignity, initially spared by the war experience and conserved in the intellectual networks of Paris, vanishes. And even worse, he probably experienced to have contributed to this mess. When the Asian looking girl comes straight to the point asking if he wanted to ""fuck"" her, while he was still trying to frame his intentions more elaborately as a gentleman, he must have ultimately realized that everything was over. He was not even part of the outlaw movement anymore. He was just some random individual that was perceived as following its most primal instincts. At that point, he say ""NO. Don't you dare to leave."" Another point of no return.Yes, because there he was. An alcoholic, post-intellectual and vulgar individual. What was left to do, but to escape everything and forget about what he once deemed important by making another baby and becoming a family man after all. The rage and violence have vanished in the final scenes, simply because anything that he could rage about was dead.Apart from that, as already mentioned, the film was catchy, atmospheric and somewhat epic.",8
311,The other biopic,"While another biopic that was as crazy as that (about Bob Dylan) did not work for me, though it was (almost?) as hard to comprehend as this one, I enjoyed watching this one. Though I cannot put my finger on it or can I explain what made this movie work for me. It's not like I know the guy so good that I could tell you his biography. Sometimes I didn't even know that there was supposed to be a very famous (female) person on screen. Of course I realized who they were supposed to be after a few minutes, but still ...This is very free and takes quite a few creative freedoms and decisions. But you will either like it for that or think it is just ... well rubbish to say the least. It's hard to really put a stamp on this, but if you can't get a hold of the movie after a few movies, it's better to listen to the urge to shut it off. Give it a try, if you are experimental and/or a fan ...",7
312,Quelle Bummeur!,"This smoky snazzy superficial look at the life of sex and song of Serge Gainsbourg and the women he seduced is a fairly interesting movie. However at 130 mins it can do with a haircut. In fact most everyone in the film could have done with one, or at least a comb. All bohemian, lazy, sleepy and ennui soaked, we get to see how boy Lucien Gainsbourg morphed from butterfly child into Serge the Caterpillar adult with his 'charms' exuding Gallic sex appeal to some very famous pop culture women. His comic book songs are really just bubblegum and the Bonnie Parker song of 1967 is a ridiculous moment in radio junk. I remember these songs from 42 years ago and all this film did was remind me how silly the songs were... like something from a BEACH PARTY drive in movie but with Serge and Brigitte pouting and spouting at each other. The Jane Birkin years are far more interesting but the film slides into maudlin parody of what is becoming a boring indulgent man by the 2 hour mark. Seeing him flopping around a disco is tragic and boring. The use of a puppet as his alter ego is a terrific device. The film is well made and overall a few blips above interesting. The shattering news that actress Lucy Gordon suicided at age 28 casts a really dark heartache over the film. Remember those awful Euro pop songs of the 60s like Blue Blue My love Is Blue... well we are in a bio about a man who wrote songs just a bit better than that. It all just reminds you to see Euro pop flicks like BARBARELLA again. If you go into this willing to float along with it, then you will be satisfied.",6
313,The Life of a Man Who Did Live...,"'Gainsbourg' is both a natural history of the man portrayed and the idea of the man. The brilliant use of creature effects in the make-up of Doug Jones - 'Pan' from 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a multi-layered touch, not enforcing an opinion of Serge upon the audience as such a trick might, but illustrating several things Gainsbourg triumphed over. All of these were his ""self"". He embraced and made his own the negative and positive appraisals people made of him, could deflect his enemies as well as magnetise friends and lovers. There were many lovers.Bardot is present and accounted for and her portrayal here does little to shift the notion that she was a muse for artists who lusted after her rather than be a truly great artist herself. A panoply of women passed through Gainsbourg's bed linen, but it is his soul mate, Jane Birkin, who provides the beating heart of the film.Portrayed almost chillingly by the late British actress Lucy Gordon, Birkin is first portrayed as the eternal little girl found and nurtured into womanhood by Gainsbourg - with all the ponderous ambiguity that entails - only to become the ""adult"" in the relationship, she realizing that Gainsbourg's talent, gift and curse was that he was an eternal little boy. His years basking in his legendary status in the 1980s, for which he was repudiated and gained another reputation outside France as a ""dirty old man"" (ask Whitney Houston... no, he apologised for that on the same chat show though that apology is rarely seen) retain the wistful whimsy of the former half of the film, but do seem a touch like an afterthought. Overall you are left with the sense that this was a man who lived, who was a misogynist who prized women, an artist whose upbringing was comfortable yet whose spirit could play the scale of emotions on heart strings; whose very charisma could melt his enemies' ire.If 'Initial BB' doesn't become the new French national anthem by the end of the year I will be disappointed.",8
314,a language that we can all understand,"The life and death of a musical legend is always a good excuse to make a film of grandeur. Even better if the deceased is as bizarre and sensual as the French social rebel Serge Gainsbourg. Serge Gainsbourg: Vie Heroique is the directorial debut from Franco-Belgian comic book writer Joann Sfar, slipping excessive imagination and the odd animation into the already overflowing glass of Gainsbourg's life story.The risqué lyrics of 'Je T'aime...Moi Non Plus', Brigitte Bardot enigmatically singing ""SHEBAM! POW! BLOP! WIZZ!"" in 'Comic Trip', Gainsbourg dancing with his fingers across pianos and guitars, and, of course, the comic viewing of old alcoholic Serge slurring in clubs beside young hipsters. What the film lacks in biographical detail it makes up for in the precocious glamour of Gainsbourg. It's probable that nobody could ever quite retell his life with the splendour that it deserves, but Sfar has certainly painted a video in a language that we can all understand. NM",8
315,"Gee, Sarge ...","Whilst I bow to no one in my love of both France as a nation and French culture I have always been bemused by the French readiness to iconicize a man whose ugliness bordered on the grotesque, a stranger to soap, water, shaving cream and razors, Olypic Gold standard chain smoker with little or no discernible charisma, purported song writer who churned out non or even anti-melodic songs with lyrics that were 1)simplistic, 2)banal and 3) little more than graffiti. Thinking that a film based on this freak may help me understand his hold over an entire nation I checked it out. It begins, I have to say, promisingly with interesting credits and an initial section set in Occupied Paris and featuring such genuine icons as Frehel, played by the brilliant Yoland Moreau, but soon, inevitably, the eponymous character begins writing what passes for songs amongst the easily pleased. The actor chosen to portray Gainsbourg contrives to match the real thing in ugliness and reminds us that for every Tyrone Power there was a Humphrey Bogart, for every Stewart Granger a James Mason and for every Gerard Philippe a Jean-Paul Belmondo, all very attractive to the female sex but do I need to remind you that Bogart, Mason and even Belmondo had both talent and charisma in spades whereas Gainsbourg was just ugly.",5
316,The limits of a biopic are the limits of the life depicted,"This 2010 biopic—directed by comic book artist Joann Sfar, who wrote the script with Isabel Ribis based on Sfar's graphic novel—came across every bit as messy and undisciplined as its subject's life. Serge Gainsbourg (played beautifully by Eric Elmosnino) was a French painter and highly successful musician and songwriter of the 1960s and 1970s, who is considered a leading, if occasionally scandalizing, figure in French pop music. Sfar gives Gainsbourg an imaginary alter-ego (La Gueule, played in a cartoonish mask by Doug Jones) who at first is his cheerleader, encouraging him to create and perform, but who comes to be a darker force, egging on his bad behavior. (It's somewhat reminiscent of how Michael Keaton was dogged by his former self in Birdman.) Meanwhile, Gainsbourg bounces from one love affair to another and in and out of marriage, having notable liaisons with Brigitte Bardot, Juliette Gréco, and a ten-year relationship with British actress Jane Birkin. His time is spent at the piano writing songs for his lovers and smoking thousands of cigarettes. The movie credits are charming and undoubtedly reflected the talents and eye of Sfar, and the early scenes of the movie about Gainsbourg when he was a precocious young boy (before he changed his name from Lucien Ginsburg), defiantly wearing his yellow star, are charming. But, in a rare concession to boredom, I abandoned the movie after an hour and a half, missing the artist's final downward spiral and his popular reggae period, too. Not to mention the heroic of the film's title.",5
317,Was it really two hours ? It felt like five minutes ...,"There was probably a good few hundred reasons to fail that movie about the life of the most famous french song writer but I was happy to find out the director didn't fall in any of these traps. This movie was poetic, touching, elegant and engaging. Retracing Lucien Ginsburg's life with style and a touch of romanticism, the two hours unfolded so quickly that I was almost surprised when the credits started to roll. From his childhood in Nazi occupied Paris to his encounters with Boris Vian or Les Freres Jacques, from his rise to success with Bardot or Jane Birkin, the story marks all the important moments in the life of this unforgettable composer that has left many generations dazzled by his craftsmanship.Eric Elmosnino is simply gigantic in this role, conjuring all the greatness of Serge Gainsbourg, letting us get a glimpse of its never seen before talent as well as his fragility. The staging of an alter ego representing his genie, pushing and pulling him to become the man we know is right on the spot to express his inner conflict to choose between painting and music. Music is a minor art, the man used to say as he recorded albums upon albums that are still to this day amongst the most compelling creations in french song writing. Many bits of lyrics used throughout the movie are poking the aficionado in the best way possible. Avoiding the traps of linear storytelling as it has to respect chronological events, it goes back and forth through time using the protagonist at different periods of his life to put in perspective what goes on in his mind. From young Lucien to l'Homme à Tête de Chou, from the fusion of Serge with his genie to become Gainsbarre, I spent an exquisite moment in the life of a man whose music and lyrical excellence have touched me as a teenager and still remain a defining influence in my life. No need to say the music is beautifully embedded in this graceful biography. The only minor inconvenience I could point out is Laetitia Casta that plays Brigitte Bardot without an ounce of talent, but fortunately these scenes are short and quickly forgotten. I recommend this film to anyone that has remotely enjoyed Gainsbourg's artwork at any point in his life for it is an amazing and poetic experience you will not regret. It is brilliantly shot and edited with both rhythm and attention to quiet emotional scenes. It takes you up and down with the protagonist's questioning about the meaning of his life and his descent to hell from which he never came back. Thank you Johan Sfar.Ugliness is in a way superior to beauty because it lasts.Serge Gainsbourg(www.radiostationexp.blogspot.com)",8
318,Was he really a bad guy?,"Serge Gainsbourg has been somewhat hated and much more loved in France for his provocations. Worst of all was perhaps doing this reggae version of ""La Marseillaise"". One tends however to forget that he also was one of the most talented songwriters of France. But we don't know much about that, do we? Is there really any popular music made outside UK and USA? It starts with the Jewish boy Gainsbourg in Nazi occupied France. It proceeds with him as a bar pianist, who soon gets into womanizing the most famous ladies of France and also the love of his life, Jane Birkin. But all the time he's followed by this alter ego doll, who criticizes him for his ugliness and not at least for lacking talent.It's like a comic book, but Gainsbourg turns out to be a pretty shy and sensitive man. Tragic or not? Does it matter?",7
319,surreal biopic,"Lucien 'Serge' Ginsburg is an odd-looking imaginative Jewish boy. In Nazi-occupied Paris, he is the first to get the yellow star of David before the office even opens. His unrelenting flirting charms the ladies despite his young age. After the war, he played piano like his father and later gained success with his original songs. There are his many loves, a short affair with Brigitte Bardot, and a longer one with Jane Birkin. Jane becomes the mother of Charlotte Gainsbourg. Through it all, there is always the surreal figure of a caricature Serge.I don't know anything about Serge Ginsburg. His childhood seems interesting and got me locked in during the first act. His turn into adulthood is less compelling and his life story becomes messier and messier. His love life may be interesting for dropping the Bardot name. The surreal character is interesting at first but the movie does become chaotic.",6
320,Have to be french,"I think you have to be french and know of Serge Gainsbourg's music and life to fully appreciate the genius of this movie. It could have been a very sad and dark story but Sfar chose to turn it into a joyful and remarkable fairy tell. What are the odds to find an actor being a clone of this very odd looking man, with over all an incredible tone accuracy in his playing? I had a smile on my face from the start to the end and enjoy every single minute of this funny and creative portrait. The music is simply divine, of course, its Gainsbourg's! Juliette Greco, Brigitte Bardot, Jane Birkin, Bambou, some of the many women of his life are also remarkably played by great look a like actresses, all of the same status! If you knew who Gainsbourg was, you'll be enchanted, if you don't you'll discover, too late thou, one of the greatest musician and poet France ever had!",10
321,Mildly interesting biopic,"Mildly interesting biopic on a French singer-songwriter who was apparently famous (probably only in France). More energetic and original than most biopics, it overdoes the imagery. The monster that flits in and out of scenes, representing Gainsbourg's dark side, I guess, is irritating from its first appearance and gets more irritating the more it appears.Cutting out the imagery and some of the more unnecessary scenes would have created a tight, fast-paced, and much more interesting movie. The ending was rather abrupt and unsatisfying too.Great performance by Eric Elmosnino in the lead role. Like Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, I think he modeled his performance on Keith Richards' mannerisms. Good support from a cast which includes Laetitia Casta (as Brigette Bardot) and Lucy Gordon.",6
322,Good,"The setup: A glimpse at the life of French singer Serge Gainsbourg, from growing up in 1940s Nazi-occupied Paris through his successful song-writing years in the 1960s to his death in 1991 at the age of 62.The verdict: The acting is effective, save for a few scenes. The metaphors are so abundant, it takes two or three viewings to catch them all. I was deeply impressed, but from an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were needed. Worth a look if this sort of storyline appeals to your sensibilities. It is simple yet effective and you'll likely like it at least a bit.",7
323,a low-budget horror film that is actually quite nice to look at .,"Complexx might be worth a viewing for someone looking to get a few thrills. It's short enough to keep you interested and a lot better than some of the other horror duds that have come out in the last few months. The film has a really nice look to it (especially for a low-budget ), the director and cinematographer clearly know their stuff, with a quite colorful look to it all. Also, the opening scenes of the film are quietly tense, we know something is going to happen, but aren't sure what or when. It is one of the few Dutch horror films that have actually surprised me and kept me guessing right up until the end.",9
324,exciting and scary,"I saw this picture on a big screen in Utrecht and on DVD and loved it. The acting was alright and the story original, but sometimes complicated. There are a lot of details in the movie about the dangers of gaming. The main character is an unknown actress with beautiful eyes and she did well for a débutante. The movie was shot in 22 days with a budget of 50.000 euro, but it looks like a professional movie with a big budget. I wonder what this director could do if he had a big budget.The music was not original but very scary. The photography was also nice and on big screen this HD movie is very sharp and has beautiful colors.",8
325,Worst Dutchhorror movie ever.,"This movie is really horrible. Again its a try to make a Dutch horror movie, and again is a total failure. Hollands best gamers are going to a big game convention where a new game is presented. A game where you play with your own life, no computer, just you. Each gamer gets a textmessage with the message: ''Stay in the building, play the game, and win 1.000.000 euros''. They stay in this big dark building, not knowing what the game is about. As the film continues the gamers find out that the game is to kill each other, knowing this they find each other and the killing begins. This movie is really the worst Dutchhorror movie ever. Its fake, a unrealistic story and really bad acting. My score is a 1 out of 10.",1
326,Complexx (2006),"Some professional gamers lock themselves in a building after a games convention in order to play the ultimate game of life and death. ""What's the point of playing if you can't die?"" is a repeated quote throughout this film, but you'll be thinking ""What's the point of watching if you can't enjoy it."" It looks like cheap digital camera work, and some of the shots are simply laughable and staged. When the camera takes on the perspective of a door, it becomes rather head scratching. The plot has been done so many times before, best of all in Cube (watch that). I'd rather be playing a game than watching this. It gets 1 1/2 stars mostly for being short.",3
327,"Great fun, no pretensions","A movie which made my day...great fun! A group of young people enter the last level of a new adventure game, and get stalked by an anonymous killer. There's no more plot or story lines, just this nice stalk'n slash horror movie. With a very effective openings sequence, some really nice cinematography and a couple of scenes which are really tense, but with no pretensions whatsoever. I wish Holland made more of this no-brainer pictures, I'm getting bored by all the serious arthousedramas. I'm not saying this film has no flaws (the actors won't win an Oscar for this and sometimes it's hard to hear what they're saying), but it's just fun to watch, and highly underrated.",7
328,One of the best looking low budget movies ever!,"That this film was produced for about 50.000 and shot in 19 days is almost unbelievable. Whatever you think about this movie the director and cinematographer did achieve more than other filmmakers with a million dollar or more. The movie doesn't go deep, but is well entertaining and exciting till the end. A nice plot also at the end. You have to watch this movie twice to discover all the hidden facts in the shots. The acting is good enough and Sander Foppele plays a splendid dark role. The story could have been better, but for a low budget film it looks technical surprisingly good. Hope to hear more from this guys.",10
329,I loved it then and I love it now,"I can never tire of this movie, it's magical - that's for sure. They just don't make them like this anymore. It's deserves a much higher rating on here",9
330,Great movie!,"I'm still wondering why Susan and Julia didn't even get a nomination of the Academy, or the screenplay. This movie is a great movie about jelousy of a mother, that is scared that her children might love someone else as their second mother, and gives such a hard time to that person. And in the other hand, you see that young lady, in love (with the father of those kids), that forgives everything that has been done to her. She was called a bitch a couple of times (the dog scene with Ana, and when she brings the kids at Jackies, and Ana has make up). Was ignored, and even lost her job for those kids. And she forgives all of this, and tryes to like everyone. The world sure would be perfect if everyone would be this way. The problem is that the world has too many Jackies, and not enough Isabels. If you are someone that likes to cry, and cry. Watch it. Is one of the sweetes movie ever, talking about peoples feelings, fears, and happynes. Great!",8
331,'If you want me to hate her I will.',"It is hard to believe that this film is 15 years old now: it is as fresh and refreshing as the year it was made. Much of that is due to the story that tends to be a bit Hallmarky (written by Gigi Levangle and manipulated for the screen by Jessie Nelson, Steven Rogers, Karen Leigh Hopkins and Ronald Bass) but with Chris Columbus' direction and a cast of incredibly talented actors is really works.Anna (Jena Malone) and Ben (Liam Aiken), the two children of Jackie (Susan Sarandon) and Luke (Ed Harris) Harrison, have to cope with the fact that their parents divorced and that there is a new woman in their father's life: Isabel (Julia Roberts), a successful photographer. She does her best to treat the kids in a way that makes them still feel at home when being with their dad, but also loves her work and does not plan to give it up. But Jackie, a full-time mother, regards Isabel's efforts as offensively insufficient. She can't understand that work can be important to her as well as the kids. The conflict between them is deepened by the sudden diagnose of cancer, which might may be deadly for Jackie. They all have to learn a little in order to grow together.The lightness of the film is highlighted with some very entertaining Karaoke takes on popular music as performed by mom and the kids and by a little Thanksgiving talent show. But over and above the cutesy schmaltz are a lot of well shaped statements about life and death and family. It remains a very fine movie. Grady Harp",8
332,Very Beautiful,"I got Stepmom for Julia Robert's performance, and I expected it to be pretty good. It did not fail me- it exceeded my expectations. This movie is beautiful.It's the story of a husband and wife with two kids who have fallen out of love, and now the father is getting married to a new, younger woman. The mother of the kids does everything she can to make her children hate this woman who is going to very soon be a permanent part of their life.Julia Roberts indeed gives a fine performance as the fiancée of Ed Harris, the husband. She steals your heart in every scene she's in as this young woman who is trying so hard to be exactly what those children want and need. And in the end, she's searching for acceptance and love from them as much as they are from her. And then there's Susan Sarandon, giving one of her best performances as the mother of the children who wants nothing more than to remove her children from The younger woman completely. Sarandon's character is horrible- one of the most awful and hateful people in modern movies. She backstabs, she's overly-critical, and for a long time, she finds every chance possible to turn her children against the other woman- yet you cannot help but feel for her. As nasty as she is, you sympathize with this woman who is having to deal with her children being in the care of a younger, inexperienced woman who is living with her ex-husband. It's impossible not to understand her character's mourning and confusion. For the first time in her life, this woman is not the only mother in her children's life.Don't be surprised if you cry- more than once. It's that good, and that affecting. Truly, this film is one of the better delights of the past few years. Beautiful story, great performances, real emotions- 8/10 stars! Jay Addison",6
333,Sarandon and Roberts Shine!,"Stepmom is a wonderful, life-affirming film that benefits from the great direction of Chris Columbus, the beautiful music of John Williams, and a great screenplay.Ed Harris is great as the father, though his role is smaller. The two children are spot on. But what really drives this film are the portrayals of the mother by Susan Sarandon and the stepmother by Julia Roberts.This film is about universal truths: Life has its ups and downs. Love has its ups and downs. Some of the strongest familial bonds are forged from needing. And when you really love someone, there is no wrong way to do it.The story traces the progress between the mom and the stepmom--two women who have to face their fears of a new family dynamic. The mother was there for all the tender moments, all the wounds and all the memories. The stepmom is the ""cool"" one who knows the lyrics to all the songs and is current with today's fashions. To become a whole family, the mother must overcome her fear of being replaced and the stepmother must overcome her fear of comparison with an irreplaceable mother.This is a tearjerker. The resolution goes far beyond the daily struggles of a family rent by divorce. Well worth seeing.",8
334,Two Thumbs Up!,"Chris Columbus directed 'Stepmom' is a winner all the way... a true 1998 Classic! The film is highly entertaining, in fact there is hardly a moment when you feel bored in this 123 minute-film. Columbus has made superb films, and 'Stepmom' ranks as his best.The film has a beautiful story, a story about a divorced couple, their children and the Stepmom. The film explains the worth of a family... it surely leaves a great moral behind. The climax is superb, it gets you moist-eyed.Performance-wise: Ed Harris is Incredible, as ever. He steals the show in a small, but significant role. Julia Roberts is fantastic as the Stepmom. Susan Sarandon needs to mentioning, she's a class apart. Liam Aiken & Jena Malone, the kids, stand out.On the whole 'Stepmom' is a must watch for each and every cine-lover.",8
335,Teenager makes step-mom's life hell,"This movie has a great cast, but stealing scenes from big timers like Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon is Jena Malone, as Anna, the young girl who can't accept her father (Ed Phillips) leaving her mother and moving in with a young woman. Anna really is terrible in her tantrums and snubbings and nastiness directed at her stepmom Isabelle (Roberts). But you can see why she would be like that. Almost as nasty is Sarandon's character, who belittles and berates Isabelle. It's a tiny bit disturbing that the Dad essentially side-steps all the drama and doesn't have to deal with it. Particularly since he broke up the family. It's a bit sexist that the women are catty and bitchy. Sometimes the movie is a bit preachy and predictable. But it does try to portray the journey that people in these situations can go through before some sort of harmony is restored.",7
336,Such a wonderful film,"Stepmom is such a wonderful movie that has an AMAZING cast along with the storyline. It has love, laughter, heartache and everything in between. Such a beautifully shot movie!!! A+++ Film",10
337,A Stepmom review from a fan!,"I loved this movie! If you are in the mood for a tear jerker movie, this is the movie too see. Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon are remarkable together. This is the absolute best I have seen Julia Roberts act and this movie defiantly brings out her talent. Susan Sarandon can make any movie good. But she delivers outstanding effort to make her character relate to other women who have had the problems that Susan's character faces. This movie is of course a 10 out of 10! Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon will make you laugh now and then, but they will also make you cry with the difficulties that they face together on screen. Stepmom is a movie you'll enjoy and ""always always"" remember as a movie that filled your heart. So if you haven't seen Stepmom yet...go and see it! You'll be glad that you did.",10
338,A simple but well-executed drama with two great actresses,"A classic '90s drama that brings Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon together in a mother vs. Stepmother issue.It has a fairly simplistic way of plotting and predictable. The arc of fairly stereotypical characters without great personalities. Although they are not the best interpretations of Sarandon and Roberts, they achieve a nice chemistry that crosses and projects good bonds in the course.It is not a genius or a work of art nor is it expected to be, it is from those movies to watch as a family and that leaves a cute flavor with a small realistic detail.",7
339,delightful & heart warming ...,"Stepmom is one of the most delightful movies in recent times ... ! It's a touching tale of maternal love that doesn't fail to move you no matter how many times you see it. It's a gem !Stepmom tells you the story of an American marriage that loses its spark with time and the man seeks love outside of it. This sensitive film deals with how the family handles the delicate situation --- at times, holding out bravely ... and at other times, buckling under the emotional trauma ! The other woman, very ably portrayed by Julia Roberts, is a genuinely good human being who tries to bond with her lovers' kids inspite of their mother's (and their own) initial bitterness towards her. The plot thickens when the mother of the kids, portrayed with finesse by Susan Sarandon, is found to have cancer. The mother's days in the world are now numbered and the family must learn to carry on without her ... ! Stepmom now paints a warm and endearing picture of how the members of this family reconcile their differences and stand united and strong in the face of this crisis.It would be UNFAIR if I rated this one anything less than 9 ... !",10
340,two giants of cinema make this an appealing 'chick flick' for all to enjoy,"Grab a box of Kleenex, a bag of popcorn and a sweetheart to share the tears with in this coming together of two women who would otherwise despise each other. They are the ex-wife and girlfriend of a busy dad who must learn to co-exist when potential tragedy arises. Oscar winners Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts both shine in this more recent variation of ""Terms of Endearment"", ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Beaches"" where women end competition for the greater good. Sarandon is a force of nature as she goes from resentful of her ex's fiancée to confiding when a potentially fatal disease strikes, making it necessary to prepare her two children for the possibility that they will have to go on with future step-mom Roberts. The kids have understandably conflicting feelings and even when the teen daughter gets bratty, you empathize with her. Watching these two remarkable suddenly become pals is touching and rewarding, and scenes of New York in the fall and winter are beautiful. Roberts underplays her part, instilling her character with understanding and integrity, even humor. In an era where women seem intent on allowing themselves to be presented in a less nurturing light and allow the media to focus on mainly negative aspects, it is films like this which truly remind us of the qualities that make women great and give us the chance to celebrate their true strengths which do not have to result in a cat fight on a TV reality show.",7
341,Touching story,"Stepmom is a film that focuses on a mothers relationship with the new stepmother, especially when the mother falls ill to a terminal disease. The acting is superbly done. A listers Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon play the stepmother and mother, and they do a really great job. I loved the chemistry and connection between Sarandon and Roberts, it's pretty rocky at first, as most of those kind of relationships can be, but as time goes on and partly for the kids sake, that relationship gets better and that's a really sweet thing to see. The movies writing stands out the most when it is a scene between just the two main female characters, it is pretty emotional because of the circumstances that come about later in the movie, but I thought the screen writers handled it very well. The child actors were alright, although to be quite honest I didn't really like the daughter and how she played her character, for some reason I just really didn't like how she was. The film is definitely a tearjerker and it'll satisfy anyone who is looking for a well made drama film, but I do warm that if you don't like sad movies, then you will not like this one. 8/10 for Stepmom.",8
342,Heart Warming,"This movie delivers! Heart felt Emotional, Funny and spot on in everyway! Written beautifully by Gigi Levangie, and directed perfectly by Chris Columbus as they truly knew how to show the struggles of divorce, having a stepmom, and loosing a parent all in one perfect film. You couldn't have chosen a better cast then Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts, even the kids Jena Malone and Liam Aiken played beautifully off of each other creating the perfect atmosphere and warmth to the movie.The only reason I don't give this movie a ten, is do to how emotionally draining it can be. It's defiantly a tear jerker.",9
343,Manipulative star-vehicle which the talented stars cannot save...,"After Ed Harris and Susan Sarandon separate, he proposes to new girlfriend Julia Roberts, with Ed and Susan's confused kids forced into taking sides. Manipulative, ""heartwarming"" movie filled with adorable characters all hiding their collective wonderfulness under scowling masks of sarcasm. It represents the nadir of the notorious 'Ali MacGraw disease' (in this case, cancer) wherein someone gets to expire slowly, and lovingly, all the while glowing with strength, warmth and acceptance. Sarandon dances around the house with her children (""Sweatin' To The Oldies"" without Richard Simmons?), Roberts orchestrates Sarandon's daughter's put-down of a middle school Lothario, and poor Harris disappears ""at the office"" whenever the script warrants a verbal cat fight between the two ladies. It's directed at the ""Terms Of Endearment"" crowd, but with dialogue such as, ""Don't walk out on your mother!""...""No Dad, that's your job!"", I would suspect smart viewers would take an early walk. *1/2 from ****",4
344,"Worthy expansion and remake of ""No Sad Songs For Me""","Sometimes a great star is able to make a final screen appearance that his or her fans realize is fitting their stature. Spencer Tracy did it with his final screen speech to Katherine Hepburn and the cast of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER about the lingering passions in his elderly frame towards the woman he actually did love. Paul Muni did it too in his last film, THE LAST ANGRY MAN, giving a performance as a true humanitarian doctor in his final days. Laird Cregar did it in those concluding, unforgettable shots of his mad musician in ""Hell"" in the burning conclusion of HANGOVER SQUARE. And Margaret O'Sullivan did it as the terminally ill mother and wife determined to have her family secured by a worthy second wife (Vivica Lindfors) in NO SAD SONGS FOR ME.O'Sullivan left a small output of films compared to her fellow female stars of the 1930s - 1940s, but they were mostly good performances in such films as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, THE GOOD FAIRY, THREE COMRADES. and THE MORTAL STORM. She never won the Oscar, but she is recognized as one of the finest actresses of her age. The ultimate tragedy of her life - the emotional troubles that led to her suicide in 1960 - reinforce the sense of loss in her curtailed movie career as much as the death of James Dean does for him or the cancer that killed Judy Holliday a few years after O'Sullivan died.The film NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was remade in 1998 with a first rate cast and expanded. STEPMOM demonstrates how a remake can help redefine the characters of the original film and even make them more interesting. In NO SAD SONGS FOR ME, O'Sullivan moves silently for most of the film to manipulate husband Wendell Corey into seeing Lindfors as a worthy replacement for herself. But this is a little hard to believe (though the acting of O'Sullivan makes it acceptable). Instead the remake forces Susan Sarandon (in the O'Sullivan part) to make 180 degree reversal for the sake of her ex-husband and kids. Instead of a placid household disrupted by on-coming tragedy, Sarandon's household is disrupted initially by her husband (Ed Harris) two-timing her with his new love Julia Roberts. Harris wants a divorce, and being a successful professional man he can give Sarandon a lot of money. But Sarandon is furious at the slap in her face and in the opening of the film she confronts both Harris and Roberts about their adultery. Her anger also spills over into resentment by her children (Jena Malone and Liam Aiken) who fully side with Mom. It is after the divorce that she learns the truth about her health problems. But there are methods of handling the cancer in 1998 unavailable to Margaret O'Sullivan in 1950. Methods like chemotherapy. Sarandon (who is determined to beat back her illness) tries these methods, and leaves the scene to explore these treatments. Meanwhile Roberts finds she is trying to maintain her photography career and to somehow overcome the resentment of the two step-children.Now all this additional material enables the main thrust of the original story to make a trifle more sense. For after Sarandon finds all the treatments to be unworkable she returns to see what can be salvaged in her limited remaining time. This means making an alliance with the suspicious Roberts...one that eventually does soften into a close friendship as they both find each other's finer qualities. Not that Sarandon is really happy at what is going to happen to her. In one of the film's best scenes she vents to Roberts her total anger that she will not be alive to see her daughter get married. The venting actually helps break down the final walls between the two women.Slowly, as Harris, Malone, and Aiken become aware of the impending tragedy, the family unit expands to make room again for Sarandon as she makes sure she and her children spend as much time together as possible. And Roberts makes sure that Sarandon's intentions for the two children are carried out (which enables her to finally win their trust and affections). The best moment in this section of the film is Roberts making sure that Malone is avenged against an obnoxious ex-boyfriend at her high school, where (with Sarandon's approval) Roberts uses a male model she knows and some special dialog (regarding a disgusting sex act) to humiliate the boy before his friends.NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was a great conclusion to a fine actress's screen career. STEPMOM was a first rate remake and expansion of that film enabling two of our finest current leading actresses to share the screen in two equally memorable parts.",8
345,Where do I begin...,"I couldn't watch more than twenty minutes.  I tried, God knows I tried, but I was unsuccessful. I love Sarandon and Ed Harris and if they ever make a real movie together I would love to see it.  I can't believe the Olsen twins did not direct and write this unbelievable garbage. Life is too short for a movie like this.",1
346,Excellent drama movie,"Well, if you like good quality dramas, with excellent roleplay by the lead actors, then pick this one up. Julia Roberts & Susan Sarandon do the best roles of their careers in this one as the stepmother and the mother who (naturally) hates the younger, beautiful woman her husband has chosen to share his life with. The bitterness seems so realistic, I could hardly believe someone can actually act such situation. Anyway, if you like dramas that give you another perspective on life, watch this one.",9
347,"from what I saw of Sarandon's and Roberts's careers in the '90s, I would've never expected this","Throughout the 1990s, I saw Susan Sarandon as the paradigm of a serious actress, as she appeared in the likes of ""Thelma and Louise"" and ""Dead Man Walking"", while I saw Julia Roberts as the paradigm of a joke, since she starred mainly in romcoms. I heard about ""Stepmom"" when it got released but have only now gotten around to seeing it. Impressive one, looking at a divorced family's attempt to accept a new woman as the matriarch. There are some intense scenes due to hostility between the original mom and new one, as well as the daughter's reluctance to accept the new one.All in all, it's not a masterpiece but a fine piece of work nonetheless. The Thanksgiving pageant where the children sing ""This Land Is Your Land"" brings to mind that Woody Guthrie was one of Fred Trump's tenants, and he even wrote a song about what a crummy landlord the elder Trump was (and of course, the children in the pageant don't get to sing the ""This Land Is Your Land"" verse denouncing private property).Director Chris Columbus had previously done the first two Home Alone movies as well as ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", and later did the first two Harry Potter movies.",10
348,Create house-full in Punjab,"It is a good movie including romance,emotions,drama and action.Babbu maan starring in the movie is hero of Punjabi music,his songs are amazing and also the backbone of this movie.i have seen this movie with my friends,there was a crowd outside the cinema, the tickets were difficult to get,the fans were very crazy for babbu maan, because of the songs of this movie which already make the movie super hit.After entering the cinema we saw there was a rush double than the seats in the cinema.Audience shout and appreciate on every dialogue and song of the movie.the movie was good and all about the farmers and relations normally in the Punjabi families.movie also highlights the problems for farmers,the social faults in the Punjab.there was some lack in the direction and acting,but allover a good movie.babbu maan's songs were outstanding.",6
349,Legend Babbumaan,Babbu Maan is Legendary Actor. I loved this movie BabbuMaan is always excellent in his acting skills,10
350,Surprisingly original and touching,"I loved this film! Finally a movie with gay characters that's thought provoking and funny without featuring vapid pretty boys coming out of the closet and finding true love. These characters are crazy and so deeply unsettling that I couldn't take my eyes off them. They're enchanting and flawed and I just wanted to give each one of them a hug! The dialogue is witty and brutally honest. The movie is like a warped after school special. It's sentimental but at the same time totally bizarre and crass. It reminded me of the TV show Strangers With Candy. Thismovie is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's surprising, heartwarming, disturbing, twisted and utterly original. I can't wait to see what this director can do when he has a bigger budget.",10
351,Days of being wild,"I'll be brief, though the length of this video film is everything but short. The director announced that he was influenced by the works of fassbinder, Solondz and Waters. Now I love Fassbinder, I also admire the work of Solondz, About Waters who's not one of my favourits I can say he's naughty, wickedly naughty(in a way I guess it's a compliment as well). But I didn't see a trace of these in Spencer's film. It's far from being sharp as Solondz' work, It's far from being daring, amazing, heart breaking and visually stunning as any of the Fassbinder films. It's an ugly film, most of the time written and acted badly, photographed poorly and I'm not talking on video problems. The ugliest Dogma film looks better then this. It's a waste of time and the composer had a nerve to try to create emotion with his music. I wish I could say something about the story, the characters, anything-good or bad but I can't, nothing left. I find bad films much more interesting then good ones, because u can understand what the director meant and see were he got lost. But here-absolutely nothing.on the other hand this film won 3 awards ! So I guess it's either my problem or someone else's Sorry, but being daring I guess is far from doin' good.",1
352,Storm Warning,"Okay, I'm going out on a limb here, but the opening scene of the mystifyingly titled SUMMER STORM reminded me of THE MUDGE BOY (and it's short predecessor, FISH BELLY WHITE): An awkward young farm boy bites the head off a chicken. Except here the farm boy is a former porn star now reduced to being a fluffer (if you don't know what that is, put your player on 'pause' now and rent the film THE FLUFFER), the 'chicken' is actually not poultry but the human variety, and the 'head' is...well, I think you get the idea.This film is inexplicably repulsive, with awful videography, unattractive performers speaking stilted and unmotivated dialogue. The plot is surreal and unbelievable. Somehow I thought this was a comedy - but the only thing funny here is just how demented some writer/director/editors can be in the name of independent film making. If this is SUMMER THUNDER, give me a winter blizzard any day.",1
353,A Delightful Surprise,"What we have here is a true indie film. Daring, provocative but none-the-less interesting to watch. Yes, to all those who comment on the lack of budget but we've all seen films with millions behind them that failed to tell a descent story.This is certainly an original one.Summer Thunder had many unexpected turns, and truly is interesting. The leads did a fine job and though a few of the supporting actors were not Yale Drama School ready -- everyone tried their best.To that end it was a delight to follow Billy Lee on his journey, odd as it was, it certainly grabs you.I hope more people will watch movies of this kind. It encourages film makers to break the mold and think out of the box. If we only had main stream flicks in the gay world, we'd be stuck with HIV related dramas, or horrible comedies about coming out.",6
354,Loved it.,"I just saw this movie at the Pioneer Theatre in NYC, and LOVED it. It's shot on digital video which takes a few minutes to get used to, but the story is definitely original and the ending is not-so-happy. The characters are 3-dimensional and interesting (and not your typical muscleboy lunkheads that you see in most gay movies!). There's also a really pointed sense of humor throughout, as you get to see how some people are just destined to be exploited and can never quite escape the vicious circle. I was surprised at how tight and cohesive the story was, too -- most indies aren't so well-put-together.Definitely catch a screening of this if you can, or rent the DVD!",8
355,Horrible Film.. horrible,"I don't think I have ever before walked out of a movie theater.  Well yesterday, while watching 'Babel', I did.  It was so bad as to make me cringe and decide that doing anything else at all would be preferable.  I shall forever more wonder *why* I went to see this movie.",2
356,"Cheesy and predictable, but still good wholesome fun.","It's the princess and the pauper at Christmastime. That's basically all there is to it. It's been done a million times before, but it was still fun. If you can get past Vanessa Hudgens' attempt at a British accent, you can enjoy this movie for what it is.",6
357,Vanessa Hudgens makes this just worthwhile,It's just so fun watching multi talented Vanessa Hudgens act in the dual roles of baker and royal fiancée. There are some not so great moments and parts that could be better but who cares. Her exaggerated English accent is part of the charm. The trading places formula usually works. And her charm helps gloss over the more painful moments.Sam Palladio of Nashville shows his native English accent for a change.Some parts are lame but it's still ok.,6
358,So cheesy it's actually okay,"I can't even remember how many times I eyerolled throughout this movie. But I can also not lie that I still quite enjoyed it.I've seen a lot of cheesy Christmas movies, but this one was by far the most predictable. Every single thing went exactly as I expected it to go.
But oh well, sometimes movies don't have to have some kind of deep message. Movies exist to enjoy people anyways, and that's what this movie does for probably a lot of teen girls.I would only recommend this movie to girls aged 12-16 maybe. For the rest of the world it's just too much and a waste of time (unless you don't know what to watch on Netflix and go watch some cheesy movies like I did).",6
359,Loved it,"Maybe it's predictable, maybe it's cheesy, maybe it's what has been done a dozen times before. But I still loved it. It's a great Christmas story and just wonderful for a Saturday afternoon. 10 of 10",10
360,Harmless,"Harmless is a fair way to describe ""The Princess Switch"". It tells it's ""Parent Trap"" type story at a pretty good pace. Very little down time. Vanessa Hudgens is an appealing actress. The rest of the cast is fine as well but this is Hudgens' movie. She carries it well. My two daughters (20 and 16) liked it. My wife (age classified) also enjoyed it. It was okay. I'm sure I'll get stuck watching a couple of more times. That's fine.",5
361,Generic princess and the pauper movie,"A movie that belongs on the hallmark channel. As generic as can be without anything that'll offend.The princess here is actually a Duchess and the pauper is a baker and they run into each other on Christmas while the later is preparing for a baking competition.I feel like I read a studio exec. checklist just now... Well the rest of the movie actually goes like a checklist too. Girls meet, switch places, go through the motions of the Prince and the Pauper but with a princess diary peppered in as well as a Christmas miracle for good measures and true love because why not. Everyone is happy all the time and you can just play this in the background and miss nothing.
It's a piece of fluff so if that's your thing go ahead, just keep in mind that the first 15 minutes is a painfully awkward exposition that was both badly written and poorly acted. Get past that and you get to... every hallmark movie ever.",4
362,A feel good Christmas movie,"This is a fun, family Christmas movie. I enjoy watching these types of movies especially the English / US combination. Its a nice, feel good movie which the whole family will enjoy. Especially at Christmas :-)",10
363,Cheesy but cute,Definitely cheesy beyond belief but was the cute movie I wanted.,7
364,Feel good movie,"If you want to just sit down, relax and watch a cute, fun and happy movie like I did after 10 hours of work, it's a good movie. I like Vanessa Hudgens and she was great in this role. Of course, when it comes to these type of movies it's a bit cringe and the acting isn't the best to hope for, but like I said, it's a good movie if you just want to pass the time and make it worth your while.",6
365,Insatiably adorable,"My guilty pleasure legacy will be these horribly squeamish adorable Christmas flicks. Not all of them are great but some are just too adorable to dislike. The Princess Switch rips pieces from other family films like The Parent Trap, Monte Carlo, Big even, Freaky Friday and so on. You have to know exactly what is going to happen at every single step and you love the adventure and fun all the way through. This film is simple, cute, fun, and the dual roles played by the same actress are actually very good and shockingly distinguishable. The sheer idea of two identical people hardly even related is ridiculous and yet the two characters are different enough that it is believable. The inevitable build up to the reveal keeps you on your toes and there is some genuine sweet moments to keep things going.
Vanessa Hudgens does a solid job of her dual roles. You really do stop seeing her as one person and that speaks a lot to the performance. It's not some sort of Oscar winning role, it's just cute and fun and she does a great job. Sam Palladio is the Prince one of them is supposed to marry. He's not likeable in the beginning but he really does grow on you through the eyes of Hudgen's character. He has decent chemistry with her too. Nick Sagar is also good as Hudgen's best friend who becomes the object of one of Hudgen's character's affections. They have the best chemistry of the four characters and three actors. Alexa Adeosun is adorable as Sagar's daughter and Hudgen's goddaughter. She's underused but she definitely serves a purpose. Suanne Braun, Mark Fleischmann, Sara Stewart and Pavel Douglas are all good in their supporting roles. Stewart and Douglas are particularly good in very small roles as the King and Queen. They look their roles.
Mike Rohl has a huge history behind the camera in Television and he clearly knows how to make the most of the recipe the film follows. He holds things together, uses the Christmas scenery well and doesn't over extend what the audience wants to see. The film is very light hearted and then goes through a period of drama to get to the end results and it's the perfect tame roller coaster for a cheesy, cute Christmas film. If that is what you want out of a movie you won't go wrong with this one. 8.5/10",8
366,DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS !!!,"I loved it and was a great ""sitting-in, down-time, relaxing"" kind of movie. What's with the bad reviews?
Yes, the idea of identical people meeting and switching places MAY seem a bit played out but this movie has its own charm to it.
And to all the bad reviews, it's ok if you didn't like it, but I did. I think others should give it a shot as well. I mean, who can turn down a Christmas movie?",10
367,Messy and Mediocre,"I'll say straight off I actually dozed off at the hour mark and had to finish it when I woke back up so that probably tells you about the movie.It is just the same story that has been told over and over again apart from it is full of uncomfortable moments caused by the swapping. It just fell flat for me.This movie is also a huge mess. The use of stock footage is a disaster. The plane the set of on from Chicago is a every day plane but then when it arrived it was like a wooden plane?? It was just like ""oh well it was cheap footage never mind"". It wasn't even just that there was so much that I was like what?.The whole movie just felt cheap. The parts where both Vanessa's were in the same shot were a disaster. The stand in was out of sync and looked different. I don't understand why you wouldn't put more effort in.The acting and writing were also pretty poor but I get it, this type of movie isn't going for that. And like I get that they are cheap and stuff but this was just such a mess and felt really like the director was not invested in it at all",3
368,Netflix does Lifetime!,"Dreadfully cheesy cheesiness!The acting is just awful and the English accent should be made illegal. No budget for a voice coach! The rest of the movie stinks, too. The script is dire. The loathesome, toothy characters all need a good slap to wipe away the relentless grinning. The story is as old as time itself and of all the 100,000 versions already made, this is easily the very worst.If there is someone in your life this Christmas that you really hate, recommend this to them. They'll never bother you again!",3
369,This could have been worse...but I doubt it,"This is what happens after High School Musical 3 apparently. Vanessa Hudgens is very cute and not the worst actress BUT I think it's funny that she thought she was gonna be the next big thing after Disney. She tried to do serious movies but in the end she got a wake up call, realized nobody was checking for her and now she is accepting offers like this.You can tell that everyone has completely run out of fresh ideas for movies so they went back to the well for the hundredth time and brought out this old chestnut. You've seen the doppelganger thing before - The Parent Trap, The Prestige, The Man in the Iron Mask, Moon over Paramoor, Bowfinger, etc...but any of those are Oscar winners compared to this.Also when will they be tired of using the old ""America humanizes Royalty"" message? Americans are portrayed as a bunch of uncivilized individuals but who also have BIG hearts who show the royals how to loosen up and have compassion. Cringeworthy and insulting to both groups.Let's start from the beginning shall we? Vanessa Hudgens (going forward will be referred to as ""VH"") owns a bakery (because of course) and it seems to be right on a Main Street in a big city. She is the ""best kept secret"" according to a regular customer. Also VH talks about how they haven't quite made it yet and don't have the money blah blah BUT if that's the case how can she afford the rent in that primo spot?Next VH's bakery shop co-owner tells her about this baking competition a few days before it is to take place and he tells her it's an all expenses paid trip. Ok sure it is. There were over a hundred competitors and this organization is just gonna fund everyone's plane tickets and lodging for a few days AND give the winner a huge check if they won?! Give me a break! Also they just up and take off for this trip after VH says they can't afford to leave the shop and you never find out how they made arrangements for the shop to be tended to while they were gone. Guess the same magical old guy who was popping up everywhere else was gonna watch the shop while they were gone.Next she runs into (literally) a duchess who is by herself (when is a Royal ever by themselves?) and she suggests they swap places so she can have some freedom...um I'll tell you how you can have freedom...don't marry this guy and go do your thing. It's not the 1800's! But no duty calls so they go through the fastest crash course of learning about each other's body language and personality I've ever seen in a movie-and presto! Just like that they can mimic each other perfectly. One small detail you will miss if you aren't paying attention but I think is so laughable is-Duchess VH has a pointer she whips out during this crash course to show this elaborate chart to common VH. Ok WHO has a pointer just handy like that?! ""Hmm...what else can I put in my purse? Oh I know-a pointer in case I run into someone who looks like me and I have to switch roles with them when I'm feeling couped up and need to get away for a few days."" Puh-lease! So stupid! And even if a royal had to get away why would they choose to go live with total strangers?! They'd either want to be alone or wander about by themselves so that's just lame.Even twins have subtle differences which allow people to tell them apart and yet everything about these two is identical and no one knows?! So unrealistic!What about that scene at the ball where VH is outside in the gazebo? Ok first of all a duchess wouldn't just be able to walk outside on their own unnoticed, unaccompanied and unaccounted for. Someone would no doubt go with her if only for protection as most royals have that...and yet there she is all alone just waiting for Edward. It's freezing outside and she's in a strapless gown and not shivering. That was so unrealistic! I kept waiting for him to offer her his jacket but nope apparently he felt that she was immune to the cold even after she kept going on and on previously about how warm it was where she was from. Oh men! They never listen.How about the baking competition? Ok every cooking show I've ever seen shows the competitors putting their cake ingredients into a mixer and yet these two had their cakes made and baked and ready for filling before she even had to use the mixer. They could have brought the compromised mixer to someone's attention and they would have gotten a replacement but nope! They just figured it out and still won-surprise surprise!VH managed to do an ok accent at some points throughout the film but in others you could tell she was struggling. She had some kind of vocal fry thing going on that kept distracting me. She sounded like a croaking frog at the end of all her sentences. I thought Hollywood had vocal coaches but the budget was pry too low for one in this epic fail. Either that or VH felt pretty overconfident she could pull it off. We see how that turned out.The prince character looked like he was gonna slap VH at different points throughout the film. You could tell this actor was wondering what on earth possessed him to take this role. His agent pry sold him a bill of goods about how great it was gonna be and then he shows up and sees he's gonna be acting with an ex-Disney actress who is butchering the accent he comes by honestly. Not gonna lie I actually felt bad for him.I could go on and on but what's the point?The only thing good about this film was...some of the decorations. Other than that ""switch"" to any other choice in your Netflix queue but this.",1
370,Entertaining,Enormously entertaining. Perfect for the holidays!,9
371,Cute e clichê...,"Very cute, very cliché, as Christmas tales usually are, but with some very funny scenes, like the funny scene of the horse, slapstick and cliché, as all Christmas movies are, but adorable...",7
372,"Predictable and amateurish, yet captivating and fun!","An enjoyable and heartwarming holiday movie full of fluff and glitter.
Sure the accent slips, and the costumes are clearly from your average department store, the plot is obvious and the whole thing is so saccharine that it's hard not to cringe. All that withstanding; it was fun, there were new takes on old tropes, the actors had chemistry and the bright and cheery everything made the movie fairly glow. Not my new favorite rom-com, but I'd watch it again.",7
373,Beautiful!,"This movie is really heart-warming, perfect for the holidays!",10
374,An enjoyable cheesy Christmas movie,"Don't think too hard, this movie isn't meant to be taken seriously. A very cheesy, predictable, yet still pretty fun to watch when binging Christmas romance movie. No real villain or real stressful conflict, perfect for the holiday",8
375,"Cute enough for what it is, but still a clumsy story","This movie knows very much what it is: a cliche, Hallmark-style Prince and the Pauper-inspired fairy tale, and it does a decent enough job at creating cute and heartwarming moments (or eye-rolling ones, your mileage may vary). Hudgens has good chemistry with both male leads, and the acting can be weak but it's mostly because the dialogue they have to work with is incredibly cheesy. All that's expected from a movie like this, though.What stops me from rating it higher are the truly clumsy story elements. Cheesy's fine for something like this, and my disbelief was firmly suspended from the second I hit play, but on a basic plot level, there are a lot of elements that don't really go anywhere or just didn't work. For example, the rival baker could be removed completely without affecting the plot one bit. There's a point toward the end where she sneaks in and sabotages the lead's baking equipment. There's an entire scene devoted to it, and you're led to believe it'll probably lead to, well, anything. But instead of slowing the characters down or creating a hero moment for anyone, the lead notices the cut wire mid-competition, her partner says ""it's ok, just do it by hand,"" and then she does, and they win. It added nothing.The other major problem is that Hudgens' characters are framed as being incredibly different people -- one of them is spontaneous, the other always sticks to the plan, one is forthright and outspoken, the other shies away from the spotlight -- but in practice they're completely... well, interchangeable. One of them goes off brief and gets in a spontaneous snowball fight that ends with her tangled up on the ground with her love interest. The other goes off brief and plays a spontaneous game of Twister that ends with her tangled up on the floor with her love interest. The duchess sneaks out of the castle to bond with the common people. The baker drags the prince off to bond with the common orphans. Everyone acts like ""the duchess"" is behaving strangely by being spontaneous and informal (""has she always been so different?""), but the duchess is *supposed* to be spontaneous and informal. It's the baker who's supposed to stick to the plan, but that's something she's never shown doing. There needed to be a much bigger difference in the characters' personalities, because there really wasn't anything to distinguish them beyond an accent.I also would've liked the wish-granter's story to resolve in any kind of way, even if the Vanessas just locked eyes with him at the end and had a realization moment. Maybe that's a less major issue, but it felt very unfinished to have him grant their wishes, keep appearing to help them out along the way, and for them to never have a spark of realization or gratitude for what happened.And probably the weirdest moment in this film was the very pointed in-movie ad for another Netflix Christmas movie.Overall if you're just looking to turn off your brain and have fluffy Christmas feels for a while... there are probably better movies to go to, honestly. But this wasn't terrible, and at times verged on cute. If you're a fan of other movies in this genre, you'll probably like this one too.",5
376,Great romantic movie,"I was smiling throughout the movie :)
This is one of the movies that you will enjoy watching with your loved ones.",10
377,So sweet,"At first I didn't realize I would Like it that much but it's a overwhelming movie
definitely recommend it
I'm pretty sure it has the best happy ending.",8
378,Hallmark moment movie,Lovely movie that will only leave you smiling at the end. Would love to listen to the songs after the movie. Fills me with Christmas joy. Well done all for a great feel good Christmas movie.,9
379,Loved it!,"If you know anything about Hallmark movies....this is one of them so adjust your expectations. I am saddened to see so many low reviews, this was an adorable, festive, funny, entertaining and super feel good movie. I watched it by myself with a cup of cocoa while my husband and our two little girls slept (I am 36 by the way). Give it a try, if you're not expecting an oscar-worthy performance....then you most definitely shall find it quite enchanting and may find oneself rather surprisingly delighted. 😘",9
380,"A wonderful romp....if you're into film theory, you'll love it!","This is a really interesting film. Dan Davies is a very special talent (writer and actor) and wrote a film where all of the musical numbers happen in Ed's head. That lessens the need to ""water down"" the story by making the fantasy ""fit"" a straight dialog film. You get the core of the story (the necessary amount of the ""horror"" without its being distasteful to anyone who might have had a personal connection to it!) but it isn't overdone like most exploitation films (which this definitely IS NOT); the result is a funny, poignant and well crafted film. I really liked this movie -- I went not expecting much and came away blown away with what this very creative and serious young film maker had created. I highly recommend this to anyone studying film!",9
381,"great, great, great and underestimated!","i saw this movie 2 years ago at the movie-festival in locarno and i was absolutely overwhelmed! the acting is great, maria goretti is a goddess and the dialogues, written by saurabh shukla, are one of the best dialogues ever written in a comedy!!! (watch out for the scene where raghu is watching his beloved show while his parents are talking to him...).if you like different movies that don't absolutely follow the unwritten Hollywood-rules like ""american beauty"", ""the royal tennenbaums"" or ""garden state"" you will certainly love this movie. give it a chance, you might be surprisedcongratulations and a big ""thank you"" to the makers of this great movie.10/10",10
382,"Wow, This man is a real actor!","This movie is amazing, I mean these kind of movies will stun you. These people are real actors yeah, Vijay Raaz, Saurabh Shukla they are really amazing. Watch this movie and you will want to watch other movies of these actors",9
383,A satirical comedy on saas bahu serials.,"Raghu Romeo I watched when I went to this video shop to hire a particular CD but couldn't get it. Instead of that, the person gave me this CD saying it is a wonderful movie. I wasn't very impressed with the CD but then I read the story behind the making of the movie. That impressed me so much that I watched the movie instantly.And that instant decision proved to be right. The movie is one of the best movies I have watched till date. The first film to be produced by 30 something peoples including Rajat Kapoor, Naseeruddin Shah, NFDC etc.That was about 3 years ago. Vijay Raaz is at his best and same can be said about Sadia Siddique. This is a funny movie with some satire added to it. Raghu the protagonist of the movie has everything going against him. The only company of his is the favorite TV show that features Maria Goretti. He can't think of anything when he sees the movie. (Watchout when he cries watching the serial) He stays in a dream world where he believes all that happens in TV are real. All smiles, tears, violence etc. When Maria laughs, he laughs. When Maria cries, he cries. And when Maria cries for help he jumps to help her out. But are those tears real, are those feelings real. No. But Raghu thinks so.All my wishes to producers and directors like Rajat kapoor & Naseer.",10
384,a must see..,"This is a very good comedy movie with a satire on the current trends of Sas- bahu serials in India which have crippled the thinking of many people in the country. All the actors are from theater, so you see some good acting. Vijay Raaz is as good as ever. Maria Goretti is gorgeous and Saddiya Siddiqui looks cute.The dialogues are well written and they make you laugh.In all, an honest movie with lot of creative effort form Rajat kapoor as a director.If you are or if you know some one, addicted to Sas-bahu serials, this is a must see. My rating 10/10",9
385,Excellent,"Recently when I was in Bombay I had an invitation for the premier show of a unique movie ""Raghu Romeo"" and I appreciated it very much for this opportunity. Indeed Rajat Kapoor and his crew have done a superb job of putting together an outstanding cast that are not on the main stream of actors and actresses.  If it weren't for the superb directing ability of Mr. Rajat Kapoor, the movie couldn't be this successful.  It is an impressive performance in all!  I understand that Rajat and Saurabh Shukla wrote the story and the script. Congratulations to the film crew on winning the best film award at MAMI FILM FESTIVAL in India and many other awards abroad!  I couldn't believe that it is the first movie acting role for Maria Goretti whose performance was perfect as a TV anchor person with a smile on her beautiful face.  I will not be surprised if it makes the nomination for the Oscar and my best wishes to Rajat Kapoor and his cast.  Nonetheless, it was one of the best films I have seen in recent years!",10
386,Adorable,"Though cinema ought to be the way it is in Raghu Romeo, it unfortunately isn't for the most. The movie is very lovable. Essentially, it takes a dig at fiction vs reality, and does it with a very mild tone. There's no preaching here.Vijay Razz is superlative in his role while Sadiya is cute and lovable. Maria is outstanding as both Neeta and Reshma while Saurabh is excellent as always. The tragic end that intersperses a fictional narrative into a real one is remarkable, and the lesson that Raghu learns from that twist takes the movie to a meaningful end.With no drama and utter realism, this movie is a must watch like any other Rajat Kapoor film. He surely knows to bring out the multidimensional quality even in our Hindi film characters for a relieving change.",9
387,One of my favorite films,"Some movies have a good story that is made great by the casting. This is one such film. It has a cast to die for and makes what could have been an interesting film superb.John and Joan Cusack play great characters along with Minnie Driver in a film about a hit man returning to his home town for a high school reunion. he reconnects with a lost love while competitors are trying to rub him out.There is an assortment of characters in the film: Alan Arkin (Little Miss Sunshine) as Dr. Oatman; Dan Akroyd as Blank's main competitor; Hank Azaria, K. Todd Freeman and Jeremy Piven.This film has enough laughs amid the shooting and romance to satisfy anyone.",8
388,"""Mirror in the Bathroom""","Perpetually phenomenal every time I see it! Among one of John Cusack's best roles, I would've loved to have seen this in theaters, and I hope it gets a rerelease via fathom events at some point. This has one of the best soundtracks, an exquisite cast, some badass moments, and some fairly good writing. Really deserves praise and appreciation! I'm always intrigued by this sweet hitman movie whenever I get a chance to see it.",10
389,Consistently surprising and entertaining,"One of the complaints about movies these days, and justifiably so, is that they're predictable.  This movie is not predictable, and I never thought I'd be able to say that about a movie with four credited writers.  Every time you think you can guess where it's going, it throws a curve.  It was also very funny, which is nice because good comedies are becoming a rare species. John Cusack continues to show what a great actor he is as hitman Martin Blank.  He doesn't wink at the audience, saying, Oh look, I'm a hitman, but plays him as normal, with the right amount of misgivings and tenacity. Minnie Driver is quite good as the woman he's still obsessed with (although she was good in GOOD WILL HUNTING, she should have been nominated for this performance), and Alan Arkin and Jeremy Piven were good, as ever, in support.  The surprise, however, is Dan Aykroyd.  Just when I was prepared to write him off forever, he comes through with a great performance here. The soundtrack is terrific too, avoiding the cliched 80's songs to provide a fresh, and compatible, score.",10
390,A classic in my book,"Man, I really love this black comedy. It's very well put together, with many great performances and a dialogue that is very well-written. The action is brilliant aswell - you'll definitely see some cool stuff here. The soundtrack consists of many nice tunes from the 80's, that lift the film even higher. Well, you just can't go wrong with this one - A classic in my book.",9
391,Firing Blanks & a little romance,"I love this film! Starring John Cusack, England's patriotically-named Minnie Driver, plus Dan Ackroyd, Alan Arkin & Joan Cusack, Grosse Pointe Blank' is funny, clever, action-packed & has a great eighties soundtrack.John Cusack - as the film's protagonist Martin Blank - is superb, & virtually carries the whole movie. He plays an assassin who started out working for the U.S. Government but has now gone freelance, having managed to rationalise his cold-blooded killing. He is an amoral, sharp, ruthless killer, but also vulnerably human, neurotic, conscience-ridden, tender & romantic. Despite these ostensibly impossible personality contradictions, you never once question that his character is real, you can't help but like the guy, & never stop hoping that things work out for him. Pulling this off is a remarkable achievement & Cusack does it brilliantly.
He reluctantly accepts a commission that takes him back to his hometown, Grosse Pointe, coincidentally at exactly the same time as his old High School reunion. While there he visits his childhood sweetheart, local DJ Debi (Driver), for the first time in 10 years  when in a fit of madness he had ditched her on their prom night to run off & join the army. As neither she nor anyone else had heard anything from him since then, her feelings about this are understandably rather mixed!Blank visits his institutionalised Mum & the family home, which to his great distress is now an Ultimart', & eventually convinces Debi to go with him to the reunion. His reacquaintances with his former schoolmates are very funny & even quite touching, & are sure to strike a chord with anyone who's ever been to one of those things.Meanwhile various other assassins, chief of which is Blank's rival Grocer (Ackroyd  brilliant as ever) are out to kill him. Their reasons are many & varied  mainly involving an Assassin's union', secret Government operations & a dead dog (yes, really!). As you can probably guess, these are not the sort of things that are conducive to a successful High School reunion, & mayhem ensues.Grosse Pointe Blank' is extremely funny, full of deadpan, twisted humour - mainly from Cusack, but ably supported by Ackroyd & Arkin. I particularly liked the running gag of Blank's response to the inevitable ""what do you do for a living?"" question: a completely matter-of-fact ""professional killer"", which of course not one person takes seriously. I also loved the hilariously neurotic exchanges between Blank & his hounded shrink (Arkin), who ends every conversation with ""Don't kill anyone!"" There's also a lovely little story involving a pen...The film is also a great action flick - it has some brilliantly choreographed & executed gunfight & hand-to-hand fight sequences  in fact some of the best I've ever seen. Cusack looks, or at least is made to look, like a pretty decent athlete himself. The finale is a real tour-de-force, & for me sums up the movie itself: a great gunfight, clever & hilariously funny.This film is wonderful from start to finish  if you haven't done so already, see it now!",8
392,Great Movie,"I love this movie. Grosse Pointe Blank is smart and witty and has a stunning 1980s soundtrack. Martin Blank (Cusack) is an angst ridden international hit-man who has stopped enjoying his work. He searches for meaning in his life and returns to Grosse Pointe, Michigan for his 10th year High School reunion and one last job. Blank meets his mom, some old friends and discovers that his childhood home has been knocked down to make way for a convenience store. He ponders his life choices and has recurring dreams about Debi Newberry (Driver) the girl he stood up on Prom night. Blank's activities have attracted a collection of hit men trying to find an excuse to kill him. These include Aykroyd, two federal agents and a freelance Basque hit-man. There is a shoot-out at the end and overall the film has a large body count, but Cusack makes Blank seem like a lovable version of Jason Bourne. The film is something of an ensemble piece with great comic performances from Alan Arkin, Joan Cusack, Jeremy Piven and Aykroyd. The film pokes fun at the loner tough guy hero featured in so many Hollywood movies. At the time of its release the story was a little unusual but Mr and Mrs Smith has since explored similar territory of rich cosmopolitan assassins trying to blend into ordinary American life. Blank spends most of the movie in pursuit of Debi. Will she forgive him? Will he have time to complete his assignment? This is my idea of a great movie. It's funny and clever and the characters are flawed but likable.",9
393,"Hilariously Light and Fluffy, Yet Dark Comedy","Sometimes one bad apple ruins the whole thing. One drop of taint makes the best things in life go bad. An this movie was full of potential taint. It could have been Minnie Driver (the weak point of ""Good Will Hunting""). It could have been Dan Ackroyd (whose comedic routines can go from great in ""Ghostbusters"" to stupid in ""Coneheads""). Or maybe it could even have been the fact the writers and director really have no prior experience in making a big film. But the potential taint never happened and this film came out almost flawless.Minnie Driver was given such a small role that her poor acting and unbelievable character (which, I guess isn't her fault) could be overlooked and placed in the margin. Not her worst performance, but not her best (which might be ""Beautiful"").Dan Ackroyd was superb, actually presenting us one of the funnier yet darker villains in cinematic history. His delivery of Bible verses while shooting willy-nilly through a target's house? Diabolical! The directing was respectable and the writing was spot-on. Some great dialog between the characters and the story could not be beat. Seriously.The Cusacks? Oh my! John Cusack is a winner in everything he's ever done (besides maybe ""One Crazy Summer""). This movie is one of his best, almost as memorable as ""Say Anything"" (though that one is flatly unbeatable). Joan Cusack was also pretty cool as a receptionist and her rapport with John is clear and shines in the film. I'm not buying a phone from her, though. And John's sparring with his kickboxing instructor? Those lessons have paid off! Jeremy Piven? Stupendous, as good if not better than his ""Chasing Liberty"" role. Having starred in 10 films with John Cusack, this is probably their best together.There are so many more praises I could heap on this movie, but I shouldn't have to. If you want to see a funny, quirky and well-crafted tale about a professional hit-man and a high school reunion, this is your film of choice. You might rent ""Michelle and Romy"", but not only will you not get the hit men, but you'll get a piece of dog doo, as well. So choose wisely.",9
394,A Nutshell Review: Grosse Pointe Blank (1997),"I've keeping my run of John Cusack movies with each trip to the library. Not that I'm on the lookout for his old movies deliberately, it just happens. Not that I'm complaining, but he's always been one of the few who play characters so diverse, it's almost impossible to stereotype him. He's fast becoming one of my favorite actors, besides Morgan Freeman, and Denzel Washington, amongst others.School reunions are one of those social events that you either love, or loathe. If you're a somebody back then, and are sort of somebody right now, it presents to you an opportunity to brag about it. If you're cruising along fine, then you're probably curious about how others are doing, and want to take stock. If you're a nobody then, or now, then you'll probably not want to attend at all.John Cusack plays Martin Blank, a professional hit-man whose at the crossroads of that decision. 10 years ago, he abandoned his date for the prom, and never made contact ever since. Also, he's wondering how he could possibly tell anyone about his current profession. He's also finding that life is becoming meaningless, and is seeking for something to lift him up from the doldrums.His secretary (played by real life sister Joan Cusack - there are a total of 4 Cusack siblings in this movie) arranges a perfect opportunity for him to mesh work and play, and packs him off back to Grosse Pointe. Naturally he seeks out his old flame Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), and tries his best to make amends by offering to go to the reunion with her.However, his nemesis and hit-man rival Grocer, played to hilarity by Dan Ackroyd, is mad at Blank for not wanting to join up in his union, and he wants to bump Blank off. He's provided with some of the best dialog, and banters with Cusack so well, you just beg for more of their scenes together.It's a quirky movie (aren't most of Cusack's movies) which is thoroughly enjoyable with its excellent selection of songs, wonderful dialog, and delightful action toward the end. Watch out too for a short appearance by Jenna Elfman! The Code 1 DVD is nothing to shout about - the bare bones version.",8
395,I'm drawing a complete...,"Good movie. Particularly the part where John Cusack is using the frying pan to put his point across to the bad guy on the kitchen floor. It's hard not to belly laugh. I thought it took cues from 'Blue Velvet', with its uncommon blend of humour and ultra-violence.I read that parts of the dialogue were contributed by Cusack and a couple of [real-life] school friends, though cannot confirm this. It's believeable though - for example when he meets the legal guy propping up the bar at the re-union. His offering of the pen, the aside that Cusack should 'read the cap' and asking to use the funny quip - 'they all seem kinda related' - must have been based on a real person. Too sad to be fiction.Minnie [cab] Driver, Joan Cusack and Dan Ackroyd personalise their performances very well. The support cast were excellent too. The music was an oddly enjoyable mix and the fight sequence with the pen was the most realistic (and exhausting) I'd seen. It was the attention to small detail which swung it in the end though. Cusack's buddy's coke-fuelled, paranoid banter was spot on (""Jenny Slater, Jenny Slater"") as was the burning the fingers on the furnace, to name just two random details. The effect of this, is that they all add up to a movie which you can enjoy watching many times. And that makes it a rare gem.",8
396,What ever happened to ....,"Watched this for the first time in 20 years and all I could think of was ""what ever happened to John Cusack and why doesn't he make great films like this???""
Fantastic sound track to a black comedy.",9
397,School reunion nostalgia,"I love Grosse Pointe Blank and its subtext of the high school reunion with everyone benchmarking themselves against each other. The casting is perfect, with John Cusack born to be in this movie.Maybe there can be a reboot with acclaimed British actor playing the lead.",9
398,Original mix of romantic comedy and violent gangster shootouts.,"John Cusack (hit man) has got a violent feud with Dan Akroyd (another hit man). In between there is a budding romance with Minnie Driver and when I say "" in between"" I mean literally in between the shootouts and sometimes even DURING the shootouts. Hilarious. Original.Weird, yet quite unique combination of violence and romance. It's literally like a gangster shooting someone and a second later proposing to marry his high school sweetheart. Sounds silly? Wait till you see it and seeing it you must if you are into black gangster comedies.The good: produced by John Cusack himself, meaning he had control and it shows. The jokes are spot on and the story is refreshingly original, however weird it might be. Nice eighties soundtrack as well.Any bad? It's a bit silly. So what? It's meant to be out of control silly, THAT's the fun of it.",7
399,Love it,Interesting documentary. A day in the life of a professional hit man,10
400,"Quirky, lively, kind of like Cusack himself","Cracking little film, great fun.The chemistry between the characters is good, the dialogue is funny, the premise itself is a novel idea and it could have been really poo, but it wasn't. It's dark, but at the same time manages to float very lightly""They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? ""I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?"" ""The fact that movies now have to be events that are glorified Mcfilms takes away the reasoning of why films like this should be more popular, but aren't. Watch it.",8
401,"""Don't kill anybody for a few days. See what it feels like"".","No angst driven plot here over one's choice of profession; even when Martin (John Cusack) is seeing his shrink (Alan Arkin), I never got the idea that he was all that overwrought about killing people for a living. The absurdity of the film occurs at the Ultramart shoot-out with a clueless clerk oblivious to the gunfire and smashing merchandise around him while absorbed in his own games of violence. Cleverly done.With the backdrop of a ten year high school reunion, this one takes the idea of educational achievement and stands it on it's head. Career pinnacles are exemplified by car salesmen and radio DJ's, while Martin Blank's admission as a professional killer is received as nonchalantly as a traveling salesman.See this one as much for the supporting cast as the principal players (Cusack and Minnie Driver). Dan Ackroyd is priceless as The Grocer, Hank Azaria attempts a principled government agent, and Benny Urquidez is a menacing counter-assassin on the make for Blank. Throw in Jeremy Piven for good measure as Martin's neurotic high school buddy and you've got yourself an hour and a half of psychotic assassination humor. Definitely not to be confused with 1997's ""You Kill Me', which didn't.",7
402,"Hit men need love, too...","... but where to find it when even your own therapist is afraid of you? We all have feelings that maybe old friends are quietly judging us when there's a meeting after a long time and we're invited to share what we've accomplished in our lives; so imagine how persistent that sense of awkwardness must be if it turns out that you've become a professional killer. In such a position, is it possible to rectify past mistakes, or will you always be marked out as a loner following a lethal agenda?One of my favourite sequences in the film is when Martin Blank returns to the house he grew up in, only to find that it's been razed to the ground and turned into a convenience store. Any fond memories he might've held concerning his old identity have been destroyed, and instead of the chance to reminisce, he finds himself pitched into a gun battle inside this most blatant symbol of personal change. How can he complain about such mercenary corporate acquisitions of land, when he himself has chosen his morally dubious career also for the pursuit of profit? The person who is the highest bidder wins the spoils, and if he wants to rekindle his lost love, then he'll have to be brave enough to confront old ghosts from the past at his high-school reunion.John Cusack has always been skilled at projecting a low-key, angst-ridden conscience on film, and Minnie Driver is also perfect playing the level-headed lass who often evaluates situations with a kind of bemused detachment. With the help of the rest of the cast, the pair make this off-kilter romantic comedy glide smoothly along, and help to guarantee that there's also room left over for a few moments of poignant reflection. ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" is a film that hits all of its Gen X targets with ruthless efficiency.",8
403,This is the much better version of KILL BILL not to mention it came FIRST!,Why does that weirdo Tarantino get so much credit when he rarely puts out anything original? This so much better than the ordinary comedy with a hitman twist. This delivers Cusack is a premium actor and the supporting cast is just as good. Put his one on your list of all-time greats.,10
404,Hit And Miss,"On the whole this is an enjoyable romp which contrives to blend nostalgia with violence and romantic comedy in a fairly harmless way. Lead John Cusack who is invariably good value, scores as a hit man accepting the clichéd 'one last job' before retiring to raise alfalfa, being talked into attending a ten-year High School reunion in his home town in which, of course, he hasn't set foot in those same ten years, after walking out on his girl, Minnie Driver, plus everyone he knew. The weak link in the plot is the fact that he fails to open the envelope containing details of his latest 'contract' until virtually the last moment when he discovers - a touch too neatly - that it is, in fact, Driver's father. If you can get past that you'll probably enjoy the movie.",6
405,"Entertaining, well written, great cast.","Absolutely enjoyable movie with a great 80's soundtrack. Action, romance, comedy. If you're a John Cusack fan this is one for the list. I'm not a fan of Minnie Driver but even she is tolerable in this flick. Basic premise; a hitman goes to his high school reunion.",8
406,"Public Is Smarter, More Moral Than Film Critics","When it comes to movies, the public usually will give you a lot better idea about the merits of a film. I can't recall how many times I have seen a ""critics favorite"" be a piece of garbage while another film the critics dismiss was a big hit and a good movie to watch.This is another example of one of those critics' favorites, one of these modern- day black comedies in which the humor is almost nonexistent and the characters are mostly annoying. Make no mistake: Minnie Driver IS annoying, big-time, in the female lead ""Debi Newberry.""I like quirky characters in films, but if you don't pull it off right, those weirdos aren't funny, they are just dumb. In ""Fargo,"" they are funny; in this they are stupid. And if you are looking for good-guy hit men (oxymoron?) stick with Jean Reno in ""Leon,."" not John Cusack's character in this box-office flop.Give the public credit: it has infinitely more sense than your daily newspaper critics.",1
407,I bought it for $5,"Great soundtrack, solid cast, and so many offbeat moments make this a great watch. I love the scene where Cusack and Driver meet for the first time in 10 years. Weave back and forth warily, kiss frantically for five seconds, and then withdraw and stare again. It's very hard to pick a best scene but I would choose Cusack talking to Driver's father before they head out to the reunion. Love the dialogue. And I'm not a child of the 80s.",9
408,Great screenplay,Minnie Driver is a deejay in John Cusack's Grosse Point Blank. She has been waiting 10 years since he deserted her at their high school prom. Dan Ackroyd wants to form an assassin's union. The film starts out with an assassination gone wrong and Cusack opts to go to Detroit for his high school reunion and a last hit. There Dan Ackroyd and others are trying to kill him. The high school dance is very unique for an assassin film. Cusack holds a baby and feeds it. Strange. But soon after there is the most memorable shootout where a house is completely destroyed. This is a memorable film. Joan Cusack plays a wonderful assistant and delivers the best performance. Ann Cusack is also in the film. It was filmed in L.A. Jankiewitz wrote the story. Alan Arkin is great as Blank's psychiatrist.,10
409,Fantastic - a filmed theatre performance.,"If one is interested in Hemingway at all, you'll love this. It's a one man performance of Hemingway's life and a one woman who plays different women of his life.The description written for this IMDB makes it seem like a documentary which it is not.",9
410,Awfully awful,"This was one of those horror movies where you hope all the characters get killed quickly, because they're so annoying. They're not just annoying, they are annoying clichés of characters.Obnoxious frat boy? Check, he's here, let's hope he gets knocked off first. Sexy lesbians? Yup, they play that for the little bit it's worth. Logical, level-headed survivor type girl? Yeah, you'll spot her in the first two minutes. Screaming teenagers? Sure enough.This is an attempt to get some of the atmosphere of other horror movies and make it work in a mix. It doesn't work, it just comes across as a blatant ripoff without humor or originality of any kind. During the first ten minutes you'll find yourself hoping that the bad guy mops them up quick and then goes to Cancun for a vacation with some margaritas and maybe beach babes. That would have been a huge improvement over what you get, which is the worst and most predictable elements of the last ten slasher movies you saw.",1
411,I Have Seen This Storyline Many Times,"While driving to Las Vegas with his college friends Rachel (Catherine Wreford), Liz (Tiffany Kristensen), Atlanta (Ashley Rebecca Hawkins), Sophie (Myiea Coy) and Adam (Tom NageL), the selfish and wealthy Mark (Alan Ritchson) decides to take a shortcut. Mark stresses with the driver of an old tow truck, and suddenly he sees a woman crossing the road and has a serious car accident. His friend Liz dies, and Mark and Adam run after the girl, who is wounded. The group decides to seek help while Atlanta stays with the severed body of Liz in the car. They find an old house in the woods where a family of psychopaths lives and they are chased by the insane family.One that reads my summary above would immediately recalls ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", ""Wrong Turn"", ""Timber Falls"", ""House of Wax"", ""Wolf Creek"", ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and probably another dozen rip-offs of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and remakes. Therefore, there is no originality in the predictable plot. However, the unknown cast has many young actors and actresses and their performances are not bad. I agree that this routine of repeating and repeating the same storyline is annoying, but ""The Butcher"" has qualities and is not as bad as mentioned in many reviews. As an incentive to the young cast, my vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Açougueiro"" (""The Butcher"")",6
412,The Hills Have People Under the Wrong Turn Massacre,"As you can probably guess from the review title, ""The Butcher"" is a mishmash of at least a dozen other better (or at least more entertaining) movies. Six young people are driving to Las Vegas when one decides to take a shortcut. They suffer a car accident when a strange girl runs in front of their SUV, killing one of their own (in pretty much the best kill of the movie). Pursuing the stranger leads to an encounter with the titular Butcher.There's really not one likable character in our main group, but you don't really root for the Butcher either - not one character has a defining moment to either put you off or win you over. The most horrifying part comes at the very end, where it seems like we're going to have to sit through the whole thing again before the credits mercifully roll. The gore is tame, the plot is tedious, and the whole thing is pretty soul-less. A sense of fun or love for the genre can go a long way, but we get none of that here.PS: I decided to do a review of this one while it was still relatively fresh in my mind because I'm 90% sure I've sat thru it at least once before but it's so unmemorable and derivative of so many recent ""let's make a real old fashioned 80s slasher"" movies that have come out in the past few years that I'm not totally sure. At least this way, there's proof of at least one viewing.",2
413,wtf!!!!,"Can this be possibly the worst movie ever put to celluloid? OK obvious over-the-top characters, frat boy, lesbian's, lonely guy, black token actor and female lead, was this script pulled from the are you smarter then a 5th grader.SPOILERS: 1.first off what was with frat boy not changing the flat 2.who closes the sunroof on there friends while they are hanging halfway out.3.exactly what patch of road did frat boy hit to cause him not to stop the vehicle safely, never mind at such a long distance, unless he was looking for the nearest branch.4.even as obnoxious as frat boy was not even he should have been so callous as to be concern with the car then his friend being cut in half.5.why would everyone leave the car and leave the one girl behind with half a lesbian? 6.why were these supposed young people so winded after running a few feet.7.when the lesbian was running away why couldn't she leave limp-along in the dust? 8.why would frat boy having noticing what was producing the smoke not share this bit of info with his girlfriend at the very least? I can go on and on about the well I won't say plot holes u really need a plot to have holes to begin with, and besides Sophie's Choices (pun intended) going off on her own and not having the strength to fight off some tired old hag, oh yeah never mind having been drowned for all about 20 seconds and her so called friend not even trying to resuscitate her.But what was the deal after having grabbed the sheriff's keys and running right passed a perfectly good escape vehicle? I don't comment much here, actually this maybe my second time, and it's often said there are much worst movies out there, but this is the worst I've ever personally experienced!",1
414,Rip-Off of other movies but still good enough to entertain,"The script of ""The Butcher"" was obviously written taking bits from Wrong Turn and The Hills Have Eyes with a little scent of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Although not so violent as the latter, this flick doesn't fail to the genre: Horror.However I must ask the Screenwriter why he gave the name ""The Butcher"" to this film. A most suitable name would be ""The Insane Family"". I'll bet you'll say the same thing after seeing this.The acting is not bad, the special effects are good and the story doesn't run into the clichés usually made, except for the spoken dialogs. Stupid lines and nonsenses like asking if anybody is there in an obvious empty house and calling for help in the woods knowing that the killer is doing a chase was a completely dumb thing to write making it unoriginal as seen in other films countless times.I must point out the unreal factor not exclusive of this movie but always seen in others of the same genre. After the death of their female friend, there's some convincing acting about her death, but then is all forgotten and everyone is ""cool"" and behaving as if nothing horrible has happened.Nevertheless I found ""The Butcher"" entertaining and far better than ""Venom"" and because it showed a good directing and things that were very different from those movies mentioned. We do not see the usual way of a teenager get killed like in Jason Friday 13th or Halloween and we have always the perspective where the killer is and where the victims are.There's some slow pace at the middle of it and the gore is not intense but all the action and the subsequent end turns this into a mildly enjoyable time spent.Definitely a good renting. (Actually, the best thing, and if you can, it's to try to see it free).",5
415,what were they thinking?????,"as a big slasher film fan i have to say this one, fulfill it's complement: be a horror movie. But there's just something about and it's the fact that: it's just wrong. When i was watching it at one point i though i was watching, wrong turn, then i star thinking about the Texas chainsaw massacre, then hills have eyes and finally i know what you did last summer, the movie it's basically a mix of all these other movies but unsuccessfully did what those other movies did, it's just so predictable, the scrip it's so weak and far beyond scary, instead of that it's so lame, with this thousands of clichés like ""don't go in there"" ""what it's this place"" ""he's gonna kill us all"" you basically know who's gonna die first and why called it ""the butcher"" there is no butcher in the film and there is not even a good slaughter, they should have call it ""i know what the Texas hills wrong turned last summer"" or something, honestly i don't know what a company spend money into making this crappy films. I give it a three because, well it's a horror movie after all, invite some friends over and watch it with pop corns in a boring Saturday afternoon. And for the record i should give this movie a zero but the lesbians really help it.",3
416,Bad shite always happens inside the creepy farmhouse.,"There is no doubt that seeing Tiffany Kristensen flash the Butcher is the highlight of this film. Everything else has been seen before in other horror movies.Obnoxious frat boy, token African-American, lesbians, and, oh-my-gosh, a chainsaw. How original! At least it was put to good use getting rid of the most irritating characters.Oh, that flash in the beginning, that's it for the nudity. There really isn't much gore in this film. I would have given it a PG-13, instead of an R.Stay on the main road, people.",4
417,Why OH Why!,"I saw this movie with the feeling that it probably wouldn't be good. But there are movies that are bad but still kind of good if you know what I mean. As in B-movies, they are done with a sense of style and they are charming that way. This movie didn't even achieve that. So why do I feel this way? Well, let us begin with the acting. The actors, or the people as I would like to refer them as, were horrible and I don't mean horrible as in horror, I mean that they really and utterly sucked. For example, if my friend got chopped in half I would be shocked and devastated. I got the feeling that these ""actors"" didn't deliver that. In fact, they weren't even close.But, bad acting is something I can live with. We have all seen that before. But does it end there? Hell no, there is more. Let's look at the special effects. The FX in this one is way below average. In one scene we see smoke coming out of the woods in a distance. My question: Was it necessary to animate that? I can understand the need of computing animation in such films as Star Wars, X-Men, King Kong, Hulk and so on.. These guys didn't have the time or the knowledge to make a real fire to deliver real smoke. No, they animated it! And guess what.. it didn't even look good. The gore wasn't good either. In fact, there was no innovative ideas at all. The murder scenes was something that we have all seen before in other movies. This leads me to my final and absolutely most important argument. I wonder how much of the script that was written by hand. I guess that 95% was done with the ""Copy & Paste"" method. Being influenced by other movies is nothing new. We have seen this phenomenon numerous times. BUT, you can show your influences with style. As a tribute to the old classics. It is cleared beyond every doubt that this movie didn't have the motif to give tribute to these movies. This is clearly a ripoff in order to make money. It's bad enough if a movie has 1 ripoff but this one has more and that makes it a whole lot worse.Let's start with ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". We can see resemblances clear as the blue sky in this one. How about The Butcher himself, this character is very much like Leatherface. In one scene he even use a chainsaw just to ensure the audience that this is a RIPOFF (as if we didn't noticed that). There are scenes that are completely and directly adapted. While I was watching this abomination, right about 20 minutes I said to my friend that this movie will probably end up with the exact ending as in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and guess what, it did and I'm not a psychic. That sure says a lot. Oh man, it doesn't end here, no no ah ah, there is more. We see huge resemblances to ""The People Under The Stairs"" and there is probably even more ripoffs if you just think about it.The only thing that was good was the title. But, the bad thing is that the title doesn't go along with the story at all. The Butcher could have been a good horror movie if we replaced the director, the whole film-crew and all of the actors. Then, only then, there would be a chance of success. I'm still amazed that this movie got distribution and a release.Don't support the people behind this movie by spending money on it. Instead I encourage you to download it so that you can enjoy deleting it.",1
418,Yet Another Plain Old Nuthin' Special Body Count Flick,"Thankfully, I only paid $3.99 for ""The Butcher"" from a drug store bargain DVD bin, therefore I wasn't expecting much from it. Good thing, too, because ""The Butcher"" was utterly derivative, totally nonsensical, and ultimately pretty damned silly all the way through. Take a bit of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" some of ""Wrong Turn,"" a piece of ""People Under the Stairs"" and boom, you've got your ""Butcher."" Even casual horror film viewers will say to themselves ""Where have I seen this before?"" at least once during its run time.""The Butcher"" doesn't waste much time with unimportant frills like back story or character development; it just starts with the nasty stuff virtually as soon as the opening credits are finished rolling. A group of annoying twenty-somethings (an obnoxious jock in a ""popped collar"" shirt, two lesbians, an African-American girl who's in a wedding dress for some nebulous reason, a ""nice"" guy, and a ""tough"" girl) are all on their way to Las Vegas for a weekend of partying. They take a supposed ""short cut"" (never a good idea) down a desolate country road where they're menaced by a scarred guy in a beat up truck. Popped Collar Guy takes offense at this and pursues the truck, which leads to him crashing into a tree and wrecking the car. This also causes one of the lesbians, who'd been hanging out of the sun roof, to get cut in half on a low hanging tree limb. (Ouch!) So our group is now down to five, and after a bit of arguing they set off through the countryside in search of help. Coming to a run down farm house in the middle of nowhere, these morons soon find out that the house is occupied by the ""Butcher"" of the title and his family of demented rednecks. Poorly staged mayhem ensues. The idiots spend half of the movie barricaded inside the killer's house (!!!), where they wander around looking at filthy rooms full of doll heads, dishes of human bones and other flotsam and saying ""What is that?"" ""I don't know"" rather than, say, trying to find the back door, or at least some weaponry to fight back against the killer. About halfway through we meet the Butcher's wife, who hides in the house's basement and who apparently went nuts due to her inability to have a child. After several more (ineffective) death scenes, the ""nice guy"" manages to escape the house (leaving his friends behind??? Yeah, I know...logic has no place here) and brings a sheriff to the property, but the psycho couple make short work of him and eventually we're down to ""nice guy"" and ""tough chick"" for the final showdown. Even if you've never seen the movie, you will probably be able to tell which one of them is going to get out alive.""The Butcher"" may not be the worst movie I've ever seen, but Lord, it isn't good. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, the killers are Xeroxed from much better films, and the whole thing just comes off pointless and repetitive. Gorehounds who aren't terribly picky may want to check it out because ""The Butcher"" has more than its fair share of the red stuff but most viewers will just want it to end as quickly as possible.",3
419,What a Rip.,There is absolutely nothing original in this movie.First Rip: The Girl in the road who has escaped from the psycho is ripped right out of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Second Rip: Use of a chain saw for graphic death was once again ripped from TCMThird Rip: The group of kids going strait to the killers house is yet again from TCMFourth Rip: Their college Kids! Horror movie's off college kids left and right. come on please. How about some originality.Fifth Rip: The set up car accident is a possible rip from the GOD AWFUL Wolf Creek.Though I never saw wrong turn I have heard that there is a wrong turn feeling to this movie. Bottom line people this movie holds nothing original. It can be avoided but it's not a complete waste.,2
420,Before Watching,"Did you saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre, See No Evil, Wrong Turn, Hills have eyes, Wolf Creek, House of 1000 Corpses, 1001 maniacs? If yes - you wont see anything NEW. Again some teenagers going into trip and of course their car is broken... YES - it happens in the woods, in isolated place, and YES - they're haunted by some ugly freak... I rated it 4, but if I would never saw those movies that i mention in the beginning, i would give 6. I think that Texas Chainsaw producers should do something with that... almost all movies i watched past 2 years are similar. Aren't laws protect the story? I got tired of this... I guess within 3 months I will see another ""edited"" copy of same story.",4
421,A very lousy and hackneyed backwoods horror stinker,"Stop me if you've already heard this one before: Six extremely annoying and unappealing college kids -- sassy blonde Rachel (Catherine Wreford), obnoxious, insensitive, and spineless musclehead Mark (a supremely terrible and insufferable performance by Alan Ritchson), sexy libidinous lesbians Atlanta (cute blonde Ashley Hawkins) and Liz (foxy brunette Tiffany Kristensen, who at least bares her breasts prior to getting bumped off first), bumbling nice guy Adam (decently played by Tom Nagel), and token black Sophie (Myiea Coy) -- on a cross country road trip run afoul of a vicious family of deadly and demented hicks after they get a flat tire in the middle of some nowheresville sticks. Gee, isn't that a remarkably fresh and inspired premise for a fright flick? Of course not, man! Director Edward Gorsuch, working from a pitifully trite and by-the-numbers cookie cutter script by Michael Hurst, manages to maintain a fairly brisk pace and delivers a handy helping of nasty gore, but crucially fails to create any suspense or spooky atmosphere. Worse yet, the main protagonists are so uniformly cardboard, irritating, and underdeveloped that one simply doesn't care whether they live or die. April Lang as deranged hag Ms. Mayhew, Bill Jacobson as hulking disfigured brute Franklyn Mayhew, and Annie MacKay as tongueless daughter Angel are reasonably creepy, but they still aren't anywhere near as scary and disturbing as the cannibal clan in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (a horror classic that this crud shamelessly copies to the grating ninth degree). Dennis Smith's generic shivery'n'shuddery score, the headache-inducing blaring alternative soundtrack, the variable acting from an attractive, but charmless and unlikable cast, and one of those always unwelcome groan-worthy ""it ain't over yet!"" (non)endings all add further abject insult to already appalling injury. Hank Baumert, Jr.'s slick cinematography makes this schlock look much better than it deserves. A real dud.",2
422,"Dreadful ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ripoff","A bunch of REAL annoying college students are driving to Las Vegas. Their car breaks down on a deserted road and they search for help. They find a big old ranch house, in the middle of nowhere, with a VERY strange family who love killing...Sound familiar? Absolutely pointless rehash of ""Texas..."" minus the story, characterization and scares. This also has the gratuitous female nudity and the now requisite lesbian couple (notice we never see a gay male couple?). This is incredibly cheap with glaring continuity errors left and right--notice how one girl runs past the exact same tree twice in a row!!! The story is entirely predictable with some extremely stupid ""twists"" in it. Also these kids are killed off...for no reason whatsoever! Granted they're ALL annoying but I would at least like a reason! The acting, at first, was so bad I almost switched this off. Worst of all is Alan Ritchson--he plays such a totally obnoxious character (and badly) that I wondered why all these people hung out with him. As the movie progressed, Tom Nagel (as Adam) and Catherine Wreford (as Rachel) actually improved and ended up giving two not bad performances. Everybody else was hopeless.Stupid, sick, sadistic and utterly worthless horror movie. The only truly scary thing about this is that it was made. Skip it.",1
423,I would rather watch a better horror movie,"It wasn't too bad but i have seen so much better, you can bet i wont be watching it again, once was enough for me, needed more gore, then maybe it would have been a little better, but it really mainly needed a little bit of originality, it was too much like other slasher flicks like Texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn, hills have eyes... the same movie over and over again gets kinda boring...but it would probably be an alright movie to watch once, but there is no way that there could ever be a reason to watch this more than that.i give this movie a 4, but it could have gotten better had it had a little bit more gore and originality...... ......... ......... ........",4
424,Terribly Dumb And Just Couldn't Take It....,"This one started out fun but turned stupid really fast. As it seemed like the drove way out of the way to decapitate one of the hotties in the car. And then the argument about who did nothing wrong. And that's just the start of the fiasco this turns into.... The Butcher, still has yet to appear and already there's plenty of stupid.And I just couldn't take anymore of the stupid after the 'rich guy' was pinned with a shovel and dissected with a chainsaw.

425,An enjoyable series of rip-offs,"Six stoned, horny twits decide to take a shortcut on their trip to Vegas. Rachel (Catherine Wreford), Liz (Tiffany Kristensen), Atlanta (Ashley Rebecca Hawkins), Sophie (Myiea Coy) and Adam (Tom Nagel), and squealy beefcake Mark (Alan Ritchson) are collectively furious when their journey is sabotaged by razor wire. Mark pouts a little more and almost instantly proves himself to be the biggest idiot of all in this lacklustre bunch. Whatever becomes of them in this 'Wrong Turn/The Hills Have Eyes/Texas Chainsaw Massacre' amalgam, it had better be nasty.Despite peppering the fast-moving storyline with influences from more polished films, this soon becomes a little dull. The shrieking and witless attempts to escape the gang's increasingly desperate situation becomes commonplace, mainly because as usual, the characters aren't particularly interesting or likeable. Also, the audience is always one step ahead of them, making them appear stupid - but then, they were never presented as anything else.Yet, 'The Butcher' moves along nicely, we don't have to wait too long until horrible things begin happening, it's nicely shot and competently acted. The young ciphers make a lot of questionable decisions, but despite their initially crass attempts to have a good time, are far from the worst I have seen of this type. There are also some nice twists along the way and some genuinely gruesome moments. The films makes absolutely no apology for blatantly taking ideas from elsewhere, and I quite admire them for such shamelessness. My score is 6 out of 10.",6
426,"""Oh, Mama, can this really be the end?""","I was glad I was exercising at home while this mind-numbing piece of drek droned on and on and on. Otherwise, I would have completely wasted an hour and a half of my life  90 minutes incidentally that felt like 90 days.I was reminded of some really bad low-budget sci-fi/horror flicks from the '50s, like The Beast With 50 Million Eyes. The Butcher contained some of the same, uh, qualities: no plot, bad writing, mostly annoying characters consistently blurting out stupid, senseless remarks. The director showed no ability for pacing (the film just sat there, congealing) or suspense or character development, i.e., there was NO pacing NO suspense NO interesting characters. As for the latter, it was hard to tell whether the actors & actresses could be any good, seeing how they were given so little of substance with which to work. As it stands on film, though, they either showed the emotions of a cardboard cut out or thrashed about in over-the-top fashion. And, yes, like some other reviewers, I too could not wait for several of the characters to meet their demise because they were SO annoying.I cannot think of anything redeeming about this dawg. It could never be a guilty pleasure for me, like Wrong Turn, for example. The filmmakers had two left feet and empty heads  and they forced their characters to wander around in the same way, dazed and dumb, with nothing to say. I felt tortured. Don't let it happen to you. You have been forewarned.",1
427,Not much butchering,"This movie is a typical teens get into trouble on the road story. While going off to Vegas to celebrate graduation, 6 teens in an Escalade take a short cut and exchange road rage with the disfigured father of a reclusive family named Mayhew living way off the beaten path. In typical teen fashion they make some really bad decisions and wind up unknowingly invading the home of the Mayhew's where they run from the clan and try and find a way back to reality. During their ordeal 'some' of them are killed in semi-goriness. With a title like The Butcher, it could have been a lot worse. The editing, continuity, and other technical aspects were pretty good. The end holds a few twists that were not totally unexpected.",4
428,Are u freakin' kiddin me'??,"Are you freakin' kiddin' me? There's a lot of bad horror films out there and this is one of 'em. Sometimes the filmmakers choose to make 'em bad by purpose due to low budgets etc.. That way at least you can be entertained. ""The butcher"", I'm not sure about. Did they make the film this bad by purpose or do all involved crew members really suck. The acting is below average. Not the worst performances I've seen but they're not good. The director seems to have no idea on how to build suspense or how to direct for that matter. The photography is okay. Not the best but okay. The budget of 750 000 $ is spent badly, I think. With a little imagination they could have spent it much better. But all this is not the worst thing about this film. The script, oh, the script. How in Gods name a production company ever picked this script up, I'll never know. The script is just terrible, awful.. well... not good. I'll rate this film 3 out of 10. It's possible to sit through it. Just don't get your hopes up for any scares. Prepare yourselves for laughs instead.",3
429,A mix of Horror Hamburger.,"The Butcher isn't a bad horror movie but it isn't a great one either. The film borrows heavily from other horror flicks like, The Hills Have Eyes, Wrong Turn and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - so don't expect a new story here.The acting was pretty good considering the weak script. Actor Bill Jacobsen actually did do a pretty good job as Franklin Mayhew. The directing was pretty tight but the plot sagged in the middle. The sets looked creepy. Like most B movies the characters do some pretty silly things so expect lots of clichés.Overall, I'd recommend it to rent for a cheap,mindless,horror flick, but don't buy.",7
430,"A clichéd and stupid, though entertaining slasher","Traveling together to Vegas, a group of friends celebrating their upcoming graduation get stranded in the woods after taking a detour and find themselves stalked by a family of deformed killers living in a rural house in the area, forcing them to fight off the group to get away alive.This here was quite an impressive and enjoyable slasher. One of the biggest pluses here is the strong action in the opening section which starts this off strongly as the roadside accident and repair, chase through the woods and the eventual accident that results in their friends' death get this started on a great note. That continues along nicely as the discovery of the other girl out there and their quest to get help brings them into contact with the family is some really fun scenes here with the foot-chase through the woods being pretty thrilling, the stalking in the basement is fun with the race to escape undetected and getting found-out leading to the brutal encounter between them as the remaining friends try to save him and the creepy encounter on the second floor of the house is a lot of fun with the use of the darkened room providing a fine hiding spot to launch the surprise ambush on the victims while letting their fighting here be quite exciting. These all allow for quite the exciting pace as there are plenty of enjoyable encounters spread throughout here to give this hardly any down-time as this all leads into the better action found in the finale. That is where this one gets plenty of fun encounters in a thrilling chase through the walls inside the house while he tries to break inside to et at them, a great brawl in the living room where they go after the policeman attempting to rescue them and a rather thrilling battle with the survivors out into the woods around his house that makes for a really enjoyable finish here. There are also a few chilling and suspenseful scenes here as they explore the house by themselves that injects some great atmosphere into the film. As all these give the film a big body count which also gives this one some decent deaths and gore as well which help this nicely, there's enough provided here to hold off the film's flaws. The main issue here is the film's rather obvious low-budget nature which trips itself up at times, especially in the beginning where this one tends to let them be front and center. From the way they showcase the closed-in atmosphere, weak camera-work that looks distinctly digital and the cheap feel here that all give away the low-budget nature, and while they're all problematic the digital camerawork becomes distracting here when the blurriness is featured constantly for numerous scenes and ruining their impact. The other issue here is that there's absolutely zero impact here against the main killer who isn't really that threatening as he's barely bigger than the other guys, the scar is ridiculously cheesy-looking instead of imposing and the lack of backstory until the final act makes for a simply confusing and makes for a truly lame and rather disappointing main villain. These here do hold this one back though there are enough positives here to make it enjoyable.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Brief Nudity.",8
431,"Just 'cause it says Lionsgate, don't assume that means it's good","Boy, oh, boy, did I learn that recently with this piece of crap! I mean, what the heck, they're being chased by a deranged killer, and one of the chicks starts singing a lullaby in the house?!?!?!!? I mean, you would think the baby crib dangler made of dead black crows would freak her out, but, no...she starts singing a lullaby she remembers from her childhood...all the while looking at a baby crib dangler made of dead black crows while being chased by a chainsaw killer...exactly how I'd react in that same situation! Or anybody, for that matter! I did like the part, though, when that dyke's body splits in half just because she smashes into a tree branch, that part was both stupid and hilarious at the same time! Yeah, smash into a tree branch while showing your tits outside a vehicle's moon roof, that will cause your body to split in half!! I about fell over on my rear end laughing when that part came up! And then, after she splits in half and all the characters are on the run from the big, bad killer, the guy in the Stifler role ends up in the killer's barn looking in his fridge for a tall, cool one! Yeah, that's exactly what I would do if a chainsaw killer were chasing me, go look in his barn fridge for a beer! And the whole while he's doing it, it's like he's all calm, cool, and collected!! I don't know if IMDb.com would consider what I've written here a spoiler, that's why I checked ""Contains Spoiler,"" so as not to be blacklisted, just to be on the safe side.

No explanation even given as to why.

432,Soiled action film underrated by its own country.,"People have to go and waste money like Azaadi and Yaghaar but don't give this a chance. This had more work done in it and excellentable action sequences. If your a Pak guy looking for a Pak military action flick, I recommend🇵🇰",5
433,"Technically impressive and enjoyable, but somewhat forgettable too","This movie had a lot of potential. While technically impressive and very enjoyable with some genuinely funny moments, for some reason it falls short. Of course there are redeeming qualities, such as the fun music score by Danny Elfman, one of my all time favourite film composers and an amusing turn from Robin Williams. Also the special effects are greatly improved from the effects in the Absent Minded Professor, and Flubber who is so cute steals the show. The performances from Clancy Brown, Ted Levine and Marcia Gay Horden are entertaining, and Jodi Benson (who voiced Ariel in the Little Mermaid)is a delight as the voice of Weebo, whose death is absolutely heart-rending. However the story is very predictable, and offers few surprises, and the physical comedy was better than the patchy script which in places felt uninspired. That saying some of the physical comedy has strong hints of deja vu, and is rather hit and miss. Of course kids will lap it up, but adults probably won't like it as much. The second half of the movie is more meandering in quality compared to the first half, very little of interest happens and some of the situations come across as ridiculous. All in all, somewhat forgettable, but for a kids movie it is pretty entertaining. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6
434,Fun Mainly For The Kids,"This was a fun remake of ""The Absent-Minded Professor,"" with special-effects the main show here. We see and hear the following impossible things: inanimate objects become human (with feelings, no less!) and a flying computer called ""Weebo."" Obviously, this is just a far-off story designs only for laughs (I know one person who actually took some of this stuff seriously.)Despite a bowling bowl repeatedly hitting someone in the head, it's a fairly harmless movie with no language problems, which is a rarity in a Robin Williams film. Robin is the ""absent- minded professor,"" in this ""Dr. Philip Brainiard."" You can call him, ""Dr. Phil."" There are one or two sneaky-vulgar lines but nothing much.With the flubber-substance making balls bounce forever, into every object, you get a lot of slapstick scenes that are either stupid or laugh-out-loud funny. The story, geared a lot more for kids than adults, has a nice lighthearted feel to it. For adults, one viewing is plenty, but kids will enjoy it multiple times.",7
435,"Not As Good as ""The Absent Minded Professor"" But Pretty Funny","Tastes and times have changed drastically since 1961 when Fred MacMurray originally introduced the super-elastic stuff called 'flubber' to film audiences in Walt Disney's ""The Absent Minded Professor."" In the high-tech, 1990's Disney remake ""Flubber"" reinvents itself as an animated, gooey-green, silly putty blob of flying rubber that talks and dances. Actually, flubber resembles a combination of the Pillsbury Doughboy crossed with the shape-shifting water creature in James Cameron's 1989 fantasy thriller ""The Abyss."" Inventive, excessive, but tolerably entertaining, director Les Mayfield's remake of ""The Absent Minded Professor"" will captivate both young and absent-minded audiences. Happily, ""Flubber"" succeeds as a resilient special effects laden tour-de-farce. Sadly, the remake lacks the wit, warmth, subtlety, and comedic irony that distinguished its black & white predecessor. The spectacular morphing effects of George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic Company and the visual wizardry of Peter Crosman, Tom Bertino, and Douglas Hans Smith cannot offset the film's hopelessly befuddled plot.The story by John Hughes and the late Bill Walsh follows the zany efforts of a scatterbrained university chemistry professor. Dr. Philip Brainard (Robin Williams of ""Popeye"") accidentally cooks up a gravity defying concoction called 'flubber.' Generating its own perpetual motion, 'flubber' has uses limited only by the imagination. Unlike the limp lump of 'flubber' in ""The Absent-Minded Professor,"" the 'flubber' ""Flubber"" radiates a mischievous personality, but the filmmakers never solidify its amorphous character. Not only will Brainard 'flubber' rescue Medfield College from bankruptcy and closure, but 'flubber' will also redeem him in the eyes of the long-suffering sweetheart that he wants to wed: Medfield College President Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden.) Brainard heads up Sara Jean's you-know-what list. Three times in a row he has left her stranded at the altar! If things aren't bad enough, Brainard's old academic nemesis Wilson Croft (Christopher MacDonald of ""Thelma & Louise"") lurks in the background. Oil and conniving, Croft plans to pilfer Brainard's fiancée as well as take credit for his 'flubber' formula and the millions of dollars that it is sure to reap. The professor's next bigger enemy is perhaps his worst: corrupt businessman Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry of ""Mad City""). Hoenicker's bratty son Bennett (Will Wheaton of TV's ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"") flunked Brainard's class. Consequently, Bennett got suspended from the basketball team. Initially, all that Hoenicker sought was a simple change of grade so Bennett, the top hoopster on the Medfield basketball team, could resume playing. When Hoenicker senior learns more about 'flubber,' he joins forces with the equally avaricious Croft to rip-off Braniard's discovery.Women have come a long way since the 1961 original. Disney has promoted the fiancée from being the college president's secretary to the college president! Although Sara Jean presides over Medfield, she cannot keep it out of the red without the help of a good man. ""Flubber"" implies that women indeed have come a long way, but not far enough to get by on their own wits. Moreover, Sara Jean's romance with Brainard appears to occupy her every waking minute instead of the financial crisis that threatens her small, private college. Her priorities appear demeaningly misplaced. WEEBO, Brainard's flying female computer, serves as a sort of bad girl here who gets her just comeuppance for tampering with Brainard's social life. At one point, WEEBO creates a cyber-Siren image for herself to detract Brainard from Sara Jean.""Flubber"" sounds like a can't-miss-hit from this description. If anything, ""Flubber"" proves that absent-minded audiences appreciate movies with an absence of drama. The original movie contained a richer plot with a variety of nuances that heightened its hilarity. ""Flubber"" smears on obvious slapstick to churn up laughs. John Hughes' script relies on his tried and true ""Home Alone"" routines. Hughes deserves the blame for this half-baked farce. For example, Hoenicker's henchman, Smith (Clancy Brown of ""Starship Troopers"") and Wesson (Ted Levine of ""Silence of the Lambs"") are clearly stand-ins for the Joe Pesci & Daniel Stern duo from the ""Home Alone"" comedies. Brainard's flubber clobbers them literally in the form of a golf ball and a bowling ball. Smith gets nailed by a non-stop golf ball, while a hard flying bowling ball wallops Wesson. When either object strikes them, these goons hit the deck like pole-axed ten pins.Director Les Mayfield of ""Encino Man"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"") and scenarist John Hughes cannot make up their own minds about flubber. Flubber has endless possibilities, and its embryonic personality can be playful but occasionally snappish, too. WEEBO accuses Brainard of giving flubber ""too much free will."" Flubber never seems to live up to its potential unless it is exploding, flying through rooms, and cronking noggins. Most of the humor comes from how flubber reacts to different situations more than how Brainard applies it. Because they never define the nature of flubber, its wide open character lacks dramatic clarity. For example, the filmmakers don't set any limits to what flubber can do. Perhaps Mayfield and company chose green as flubber's lime-green color because the special effects were so expensive.Credit goes to director Les Mayfield for the get-up-and-goo pace of dizzy Disney film. He does a find job of seamlessly integrating the over-the-top special effects with live action, too. ""Flubber"" is aimless but predictable fun. The villains seem less villainous this time around, and Christopher MacDonald's bad guy appears simply to give flubber something through which to fly. The bowel humor here and there adds little to the humor and seems out of place in a juvenile movie. Parents may find themselves in a curious moral dilemma trying to explain to their kids why Brainard's cheating tactics should be condoned. He applies flubber to the basketball team's sneakers to help them beat their tall, merciless opponents on the court. Danny Elfman's lively music emphasizes the fast, bouncy pace of ""Flubber"" and helps the film scoot right along to its inevitable happy ending.",8
436,"Great talent,dry story.","I admire Robin Williams.His quick,improvisational humor make him the most unique entertainer of our time.However,he does from time to time make bad choices,and Flubber was indeed a bad one,at least scriptwise.This movie's problem is not from bad performances,but from terrible writing,and that often makes the performers look bad.The intentions here are good,but the movie just fell flat in all aspects.If you want to see a movie about flubber,I would highly suggest ""The Absent Minded Professor"".It's a classic and it's much better.",5
437,"Entertaining and visually impressive, the film nevertheless falls short of the joyous satisfaction found in the original AMP","Philip (Robin Williams) is a chemistry professor at a college with financial woes. On a side note, the school's president, talented Sara Jean (Marcia Gay Harden) is Philip's girlfriend and she is deeply disappointed that he has left her standing at the altar THREE times. Yet, Philip truly loves Sara. His problem is, of course, that once he is into an experiment, he loses touch with everything else in his life. The day Philip misses his third trip up the aisle of love, he discovers something big...that is, flying rubber or flubber. Knowing this could be the invention that turns the college's ledger into the black, he is eager to tell Sara of the news. Unfortunately, she won't talk to him and is receiving the attentions of a rival chemistry prof at a nearby university. It is this rival's intention, along with a host of others connected to the school, to steal the rubbery substance for their own purposes. Will they succeed? This is a mildly entertaining film, mostly due to Williams star power and the spectacular visual effects the movie offers. Flubber, indeed, takes on a green personality not unlike the Pillsbury doughboy and bounces all over the place, causing much fun and havoc. There is also a tiny robot-computer, living with Philip, that is very appealing. Add on the eye-treat of flying cars and basketball superduper jumpshots and you have a technically impressive film. Yet, somewhere along the way, a bit of the original film's soul and joyous freshness is lost. No, its not the fault of the talented Williams, Harden, Christopher McDonald or the other cast members. They are quite fine. There are also some laugh out loud scenes, such as the one where Professor Philip starts giving a lecture, not noticing that he is in a figure drawing class, or the ones where a neighboring boy, quite rightly fears, to his father's consternation, what is outside his window when flubber is out and about. In summary, the film's problem is probably a case of trying too hard in the special effects category and not enough in the remaining aspects of film making. Even so, it is not a stretch to say that most families will like Flubber, as everyone will be amazed by the stunning look of the movie.",6
438,Good possibilities that don't pan out,Phillip Brainard (Robin Williams) is the absent-minded professor. Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry) threatens to close the college run by his girlfriend president Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden). He keeps forgetting to go to their wedding and she vows that this is the last attempt. His work with a new compound as an energy source can save their college. He has a mechanical assistant Weebo. His hated old partner Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald) visits after stealing all of his ideas and now is after Sara. Chester's son Bennett (Wil Wheaton) is failing Brainard's class and he expected his father had already bought the grades. Chester sends his henchmen Smith (Clancy Brown) and Wesson (Ted Levine).There are a lot of good possibilities that don't pan out. Weebo is not cute and a bit of an annoying jealous brat. There is an uncomfortable man-machine love story. Also he has a flying robot. HE HAS A FLYING ROBOT! That is probably enough to keep the college going. Professor Brainard is not lovable enough. Christopher McDonald is too good at being creepy and I can't buy anybody even liking the guy. MGH is not likable either. There are too many broadly unlikeable characters. The Flubber itself is fun for a little while and Williams has good imaginary chemistry with an imaginary object. It allows him to have some physical humor. Although it gets very repetitive. There is only so much Home Alone slapstick that should be repeated. It's also very stupid that people saw the basketball game without figuring it out. This should be funnier but it's not.,4
439,Flying Rubber,"Disney got Robin William's who became popular in the 1990s with family entertainment films to remake the The Absent Minded Professor. Popular with kids at the time mainly because it was co- written by John Hughes who put some of his Home alone slapstick formula with two comedy henchman played by Ted Levine and Clancy Brown.William's discovers discovers some kind of flying rubber which may save his college which is in a financial crisis. So excited he is with his invention that he forgets his wedding day for the third time. Why his bride to be could not make sure that in case he forgets, he is accompanied by two people to drag him to the church on time is anyone's guess.His girlfriend who also happens to be the College Dean gets the attention of a love rival and a mobster wants the formula for flubber and sends his henchman to retrieve it.Williams is assisted by an Artificial Intelligent flying robot called Weebo which strangely is not marketed by Williams to save the college.The film is knockabout slapstick squarely aimed at kids and they will appreciate it the most. Adults will find the film too silly, flawed and simplistic.",4
440,"When your most interesting character is a computer, you've got problems.","""Flubber"" is based upon that old comedy cliché, the absent-minded scientific genius. The central character, Professor Philip Brainard, is a brilliant inventor who has not only invented a robot that will do the housework for him but has also cracked the artificial intelligence problem by producing Weebo, a computer with its own personality that can not only talk to him but also fly. At present he is working on ""flubber"", a rubbery substance that will allow cars and other objects to fly through the air. For all his intellectual brilliance, however, his private life is so disorganised that he has forgotten to turn up to his own wedding to his attractive sweetheart Sara, not once but three times.The plot turns upon Brainard's attempts to produce his flubber, which he sees as a solution to the financial problems confronting the college at which he teaches and of which Sara is the principal. (Like another reviewer, I found myself wondering why he didn't just try marketing his domestic robot or his talking computer, inventions which I thought would have had just as much commercial potential). Along the way, he has to fight off Wilson, the handsome but too smooth principal of another college who is his rival for Sara's affections, and a corrupt businessman who wants to use the flubber for his own selfish ends.The film was clearly designed as a comedy for children, and works quite well as such, aided by a good deal of slapstick humour, mostly involving Robin Williams as Brainard. Unlike some children's films, however, such as the ""Harry Potter"" series, this one does not have much in it to keep adults entertained. Williams is clearly a talented comedian, but strangely enough, with a few exceptions such as ""Mrs Doubtfire"", he has been most successful in films with a serious purpose like ""Dead Poets Society"" or ""Good Morning Vietnam"", although even in these he often manages to find a use for his comic talents. In many of his comedies his talents just seem wasted. ""Club Paradise"" is an example, and ""Flubber"" is another. All the other characters, with one exception, just seem like stock figures with little individuality about them.The one exception is Weebo the computer. The British computer pioneer Alan Turing devised what has since become known as the ""Turing Test"" for deciding whether a machine can be said to be intelligent. A human judge engages in a conversation with two other parties, one a human and the other a machine; if the judge cannot tell which is which, the machine is said to pass the test. Unfortunately, if the human involved were one of those in this film, Weebo would fail the test. She (Weebo has a female voice and personality) is smart, funny, sensitive and lovable, much more so than anyone else in the film, so it would be easy to tell them apart. And when your most interesting character is an electronic rather than a flesh-and-blood one, your film has got problems. 5/10",5
441,Not Williams' best role,"Flubber came out during the mid/late nineties. This is the time where I believe Disney began losing its magic in the movie industry. Disney movies before always had the magical feeling and good stories. Flubber does not not have either. The main good thing it has is the acting. The acting is fairly good. This is not Robin Williams' best work, but he does a good enough job.The story revolves around a naive and eccentric inventor and college professor portrayed by Robin Williams. he creates a ""living"" specimen of goo that can shape-shift at will and is incredibly bouncy, but his dedication to it's creation causes him to forget his wedding. He ends up using the 'Flubber' to get his fiancé back and save his college from threats of closing down. I have no idea how the movie tries to make it work. I didn't really understand as a kid and I don't get it as an adult.The plot is weird, the directing isn't very good, and many of the characters are wooden. Overall, this Disney flick can be skipped. You won't be missing much",4
442,Still somewhat enjoyable as a kids movie but it had more potential really.,"This movie really feels like a wasted opportunity. With so many talent involved, how could this movie turn out to be so disappointing? It probably is due to the messy script that uses too many plot lines that never get fully developed or that work out completely the way as they were suppose to. You can say that the movie feels incomplete. I don't know, were they in a hurry or something to complete this movie? I have a feeling that a month or two more work on the movie- and perhaps its script, would had made this movie a better one.It's still somewhat decent entertainment for the kids. The characters should be enjoyable for them and some of the comical situations are good enough to make them laugh.Robin Williams is always fun to watch in a comedy but however in this case it feels like he's holding back to not completely play a nutty professor. It's perhaps a bit of a disappointing to most. When you know Robin Williams plays the lead role in a comedy you would expect some more fireworks and hilarious situations from him. His talent is wasted, a real missed opportunity for the movie to become a great one. Christopher McDonald plays a typical 'villainoush' Christopher McDonald role and he does it once more really great. Other well known actors in the movie are Marcia Gay Harden, Raymond J. Barry (boy, he's beginning to look really old now), Ted Levine and Clancy Brown. But none of the characters feel really developed well enough in the movie, with the exception of the robotic character Weebo. Of course it's not a very good sign when the best developed- and featured character of the movie is not even an human...Also the use of 'Flubber' is highly below par. From a movie named ""Flubber"" I expected something more from the green slimy stuff. It however doesn't play a that significant role in the movie and the things that are done with the Flubber are far from original or interesting. The Flubber itself however looks fantastic through some early computer effects. Remember that this movie was released in 1997 when the special effects were of course not as advanced as present day is the case. The effects from this movie look great and really fully convincing. Too bad that it isn't featured very well in the movie.The story is of course predictable from A to Z and the movie has absolutely no surprises in it. It makes ""Flubber"" a very easily forgettable movie that is far from great. The movie had far more potential really. If only that had made some better choices with its story and perhaps picked a different director...The movie is good and professional looking, so from a technical point of view the movie does really not disappoint. Also the fun musical score by Danny Elfman makes the movie a watchable oneThe kids will probably still enjoy it but still the movie feels like a big waste of some far more and greater potential, which the movie really had.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5
443,"It's flying rubber... It's, Flubber!!","A remake of an old black and white Disney flick called The Absent Minded Professor that has long since gotten a bit stale, Flubber took all the best elements of that and breathed new 90's life into the premise, most of the pep in its step coming from star Robin Williams. Keep in mind it was a critical bomb though, which just doesn't make a shred of sense to me. It's fun, lighthearted, hilarious and just a bit raunchy in places where it can pull it off. For whatever reason, it didn't sit well with anyone other than fans like me who will furiously shove a copy in your face if we hear that you haven't seen it. Williams is college professor Philip Brainard, who is so absent minded it borders on dementia. He leaves his lovely fiancé (Marcia Gay Harden) at the alter TWICE, prompting the advances of irksome college dean Shooter Mcgavi- I mean Christopher Mcdonald. He's on a quest, you see, an obsessive quest to find the formula for... something. That something turns up after a destructive whirlwind of disasters in his basement lab, and in the form of Flubber, a lovable ball of green goo, infected with incurable ADHD and an inexhaustible sense of humour. While the utter the life of the party, Flubber does have its practical uses, such as making cars fly and turning the hopeless varsity basketball team into a bunch of flying Tasmanian devils who nail every dunk. This all gets the attention of insidious local philanthropist and lowlife Chester Hoenicker (Raymond J. Barry) who greedily wants the discovery for his own. He sends his two goons Smith (Ted Levine) and Wesson (Clancy Brown) to rob Brainard of his precious sentient mucous, which turns into one of the most hilarious displays of slapstick comedy since the Three Stooges. Oh, did I mention Williams has a little flying UFO sidekick named Weebo, who has a perfect GIF reaction to everything, before GIF's were even a thing? So much to love about this little classic. Williams is his usual buoyant self, with some of his trademark razor focus diminished in favor of doe eyed, vacuous forgetfulness that would make Jason Bourne guilty for ever whining about his predicament. Special effects are top drawer too, Flubber would look dapper in Blu Ray if they ever felt so inclined as to release one, not to mention aforementioned airborne automobiles and dear little Weebo. Can't give enough glowing praise to this little treasure, and hiss enough venom towards those sourpuss critics who assaulted it. Flubber for the win.",9
444,It's a Live-Action Cartoon,"Flubber follows a scatty-brained college professor and inventor, played by Robin Williams, who is on the brink of a world-changing breakthrough. Much to the annoyance of his fiancée, he misses their third (THIRD!) failed wedding attempt to finally unlock the last piece of the puzzle, and creating a green, rubbery substance with near limitless bounciness as a result. The rest of the movie follows this professor as he explores the possibilities of this substance, tries to sell it off to keep their financially failing college afloat, and tries to win his wife-to-be back from a rival scientist. All of this involves rigging a college basketball game, making a flying car, and fighting off greedy businessmen.As plots go, Flubber is pretty diabolical. Nothing in this movie seems to make sense. This dude slaves away to make this magical substance that'll change the world, when he already seems to have mastered robotics even beyond today's standards, twenty-three years later. The college basketball team is made up entirely of 5' nerds, as if the college doesn't have its own sports division, and apparently science majors make better basketball players than artists? The greedy businessman has a chip on his shoulder because his spoiled son wasn't allowed on said basketball team because his grades weren't good enough, but he was clearly more athletic than anyone on that team, so I'm not really sure what relevance his bad grades had. And the whole romance subplot? How has their relationship functioned up to this point? I get it's Disney in the 90s and seeing two characters cohabiting before marriage was a big no-no, but this guy misses THREE of his own weddings to the same woman. At the end he gets one of his robots to stand in for him for their fourth attempt while he continues sciencing at home. How has she not got to the point of physically dragging him to the altar yet? In a very heartfelt speech, Robin Williams explains how his love for this woman is what makes him so scatterbrained, but surely that can't apply to actually marrying her? Hey darling, I just love you so much I can't think and forget what I'm doing, including how much I love you...?But seriously, you're not watching Flubber for its plot. This is a live-action cartoon for kids. As fun as writing that rant out was, it's totally irrelevant to the movie's aim, which is to give kids a good laugh. Flubber's humour is almost entirely slapstick, with all manner of characters getting hit in the face with various items, over and over and over. There are a few more nuanced moments of humour, but they're never quite enough to keep the adults entertained. I can confirm my seven year old found it as gut-bustingly hilarious as I did twenty years ago though, so it absolutely hits its mark.And Flubber isn't an entirely soulless affair either, with most of its character and charm coming from the secretary-type robot Weebo. In fact you could argue this character gets the most development. She spends her nights imagining herself as a human, creates pastiche people out of magazine clippings, turns them into holograms, and then imagines seducing the professor with them. She's a lovestruck A.I. who realises that to make the target of her affections happy, she's going to have to let him go. All of this makes Weebo the most charming, sympathetic, and relatable character in the whole movie, and means her eventual fate hits the heartstrings pretty hard. For a movie devoid of sensible plotting and slapstick humour to have genuine emotional investment in a characters death is a testament to how great that character is.Flubber is not a great movie. Even for kids there are better movies out there; funnier movies, more meaningful movies, more important movies, more memorable movies. But Flubber achieves everything it set out to do and even had a couple of surprises to boot. It hasn't aged well at all, coming from an age when live-action cartoons actually kind of worked, but it is inventive and has some classic Robin Williams moments. My son gave it a gut-busting 8/10. I err more critically and give it a better-than-average 6/10.",6
445,Flubber is for the kids.,"This is the remake of 1961's Absent-Minded Professor, where Robin Williams plays Professor Phillip Brainard. He works with his assistant Weebo, a talking miniature flying robot, and created a rubber-like substance called Flubber, which can make objects fly through air. His scientific research has caused him to miss his wedding to fiancée Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), who ends up going out with Professor Wilson Croft (Christopher McDonald). Therefore, Brainard works to get Reynolds back, and deal with a couple of criminals who want their hands on Brainard's scientific work.I haven't seen The Absent-Minded Professor, so I couldn't compare the two films. But, to evaluate this movie alone, I'd say it is just an average movie with some whimsical fun and silly slapstick comedy, and a plot that really goes all over the place. Williams looks pretty odd in the movie, Harden did an OK job in her role, and McDonald was just plain annoying in his performance. I enjoyed the Weebo character, voiced by The Little Mermaid voice actress Jodi Benson. The little flying robot reminded me of the little aliens in the sci-fi flick *batteries not included, and her little TV screen that shows various Disney cartoon scenes whenever she makes emotions is a clever touch.Overall, I didn't think it was a really exciting movie, but for its whimsical, slapstick and childish elements, this movie is best left for younger children to enjoy.Grade C",6
446,Great kids movie!,"I first saw this as a kid, when I was probably about 5 or 6, and I thought that it was hilarious. I just recently took it out of the case to watch it again with a friend, and found that it was still funny! By now, I have seen both this and the original Absent-Minded Professor, and loved both that and Flubber. Yes that is possible. This movie is about Robin Williams who plays a professor who is also an inventor and invents a lot of robots to help him around the house, but is so focused on his work that he misses his own wedding...three times. He invents a green rubbery substance that can make things fly and do a lot of other things that will be fun to watch if you are, or ever were, a kid. Eventually, the bad guys try to get it for themselves, and the race is on! If you want an absolutely perfect movie, than this is NOT the movie. But if you want to watch an AMAZING comedy, than this is the one for you. And for those of you who are wondering why I gave what I called a not perfect movie a 10 out of 10, it is because I believe that in it's own way, it is perfect. A perfect comedy, and one of my favorites. If you can get your hands on a copy I would definitely recommend it, especially if you have young kids, or know young kids.",10
447,Too much potential badly tapped.,"In my opinion, this is one of the most discreet and little-known films of Robin Williams' career, despite having had a lot of publicity and media coverage when it debuted. It tells the story of a distracted scientist who creates a gelatin-like green substance that has a life of its own and can solve the world's energy problems. In the midst of all this, his robotic helper falls in love with him and ruins his marriage. The story of the movie starts from an original idea, but it has many flaws and gigantic plot holes. Robin Williams looks good in the main character, although he does not look very motivated. The actor's tone is much warmer and lazier than usual. Flubber, as a character, was absurdly underutilized in the film, even considering the brilliant musical scene made with this character. The nature of the substance ""Flubber"" is never clarified, nor is it really alive. Weebo, the assistant of the scientist played by Williams, ends up becoming the most complete character of the film, with a strong dramatic and psychological depth and well-made humor moments. The villains are good as comic elements but they also were not very developed as characters. All this harms the film a lot and causes adults to reject it altogether whereas the children, for whom the film is clearly directed, merely laugh at their jokes. We can conclude that this film is a succession of very positive and promising elements that failed because they were not exploited in the best way. Maybe that's why the movie was never a success. It simply did not stay in the memory of that generation and eventually slipped into oblivion over the years.",2
448,"Fred MacMurray, where are you??","Words escape me.  My jaw is on the floor.  How can this be?You want to see how NOT to make a kid's comedy? Watch ""Flubber"" then count with me the ways:1) Williams isn't funny (his hair seems to put in more acting time than he does).2) It's written by John Hughes (and it isn't even good on a slapstick level! Sheesh!!).3) Marcia Gay Harden is completely, totally, hopelessly wasted (did I say ""totally""?  Good!).4) There aren't HALF as many funny situations in this one as there was in the original.5) The bad guys act as if they're in a serious movie (though since there wasn't any laughs in this one, I can see where they would get confused for content).6) There are more FX than anything else (when a movie forsakes its story in favor of an FX loop, it's not a good sign).There are more, but we're only allowed 1,000 words for reviews here.One star.  For the FX.  They're good.",1
449,Not really all that great,"Hmm, I was told that this movie is cute, and cute it is, but it is not the best that I have seen. I must admit that Robin Williams is a funny guy, but this is not one of his funniest movies. The best scene in the movie was when he walks into a life drawing class thinking that it is his physics class and goes ahead and teaches. Other than that this movie is rather ordinary with lots of clichés to fill it up. I enjoyed it, a bit, but I have seen better.Basically, a college is about to be shut down and Robin Williams is an absent minded professor who has missed his wedding three times. It is interesting that he has a robot that is in love with him and is forcing him not to marry the woman who he loves. This is all very cute but I thought that it was a little silly. The professor is very smart but, as is introduced rather quickly, somebody else always steals his ideas and gets the fame for it. The guy is basically the bad guy who is milking the professor for all he is worth. Then there is the corporate boss who thinks that solving problems is done by throwing money at it. He wants his kid to get straight A's so he throws money at it.When we look at the movie we see once again the theme of the American Dream. Everybody can become happy and rich if they simply work at it. All problems can be over come by ones own ability and that the end is always happy. This is a very shallow and idealistic theme which generally annoys me. Even though, Flubber is a kids movie though it has a few interesting scenes thrown in to keep the adults interested, because it is the adults that must take their kids to see the movie. Flubber is a Walt Disney movie, and I generally don't like Disney for some unknown reason, I guess because it is reaching into the minds of children and manipulating them into clones of themselves. All of us who grew up on Disney has been forced into a Disney mindset. I am far more critical of children's movies, and those who specialise in them, because our children follow them more than adults. Adults watch movies, children believe movies.",4
450,The Half of Everything !,"This movie is:_Half laughable: (Robin Williams)'s buffoonery here is unbearable, missing all the time, with no hitting even for one time. There are some good ideas, however in the half of it, you must feel bored. After that, the rest is weak and disgusting; I couldn't believe the nude model scene; WE'RE IN A PG MOVIE, YOU PERVERTED MOVIEMAKERS!! And what about the Flubber coming out of the evil guy at the end?!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That will live long in the mind of its watchers, not as a funny memory, but as a sick one. You'd feel that (Williams) with Disney wanted to remake not (The Absent Minded Professor) of the 1960s, but (The Nutty Professor) of the 1990s as modern near success of absolute rudeness. Thank God that Walt Disney isn't alive anymore to witness this rubbish!_Half finished: There is a love story between Weebo and the lead?! I won't ask: ""From where did that come from?"", but I'll ask: ""To where that was going?!"". In fact, the scene of her, transforming into a young lady, walking as a ghost to his bed, was creepy before pointless!_Half good in its special effects: Although the first movie was years ago, and the CGI wasn't there yet, but the original's special effects were much sane and droll. Here, it's sheer technique without even the ability to be comic or memorable. And by the way, what's the necessity of the Flubber's dance at home?! It's just an excess show for showing off!_Half attractive: In 1998, one theater showed this movie in special screening for kids. Yes, I was in my 20s already, but I insisted on watching it there; since I didn't watch it before, and considering what a treat watching a Disney movie among audience of enthusiastic children could be. But, to tell you truth, at the end of the first half, I was having my way out. Years later, I watched it in complete, to find out if I was wrong or right, and how right I was!The only things that I loved: (Danny Elfman)'s music. (Marcia Gay Harden); how you feel that the movie doesn't deserve her. And, for sure, the creative sophisticated opening credits, it's not only the best of the movie, it's better than it!Comparing to the original (The Absent Minded Professor)'s 2 movies, this is less than half of the fun of any of them.The Last Remark: In the movie's start, one character asks (Robin Williams) as Professor Brainard about how he handles his I don't remember what, and hearing mistakenly, he replays about how he handles his ""private parts""??!!.. Even as an adult, I hated it!",2
451,Bearable only for kids,"A few good jokes, tolerable special effects, that's all. This film doesn't try to be a great piece of art, it wants nothing else than to entertain people, mainly children. And for children and also other people who don't think about it any longer, it's fun and therefore able to bring the producers a lot of money. For people like me, it rather hurts. A machine falling in love with a professor? Is that cute? A man who misses his wedding three times? Not really. Luckily, we're told in no uncertain terms that John Hughes is responsible for this: the ""Home Alone`-head-bangings come up again and again. And everybody's laughing...?",4
452,"Flubber, the get together, family film.","When I saw the reviews for this film, I was expecting something very poorly made and bad quality. True, for an adult without a kid it isn't ideal, but why buy a film if it has a cover like this when you're not a child any more? Everywhere online it says this is a great kids flick, for families and more. If you're like me and read reviews before buying or renting a film, then you'd know not to get it.Getting to what the movie is like, these aren't the best graphics, but what do you expect in an 1997 film? The Flubber, Weebo etc. are already neatly done, which I find quite impressive for a film made at that time. The humor in this may not be the jokes, but not all kids understand certain types of joke, so in the film they just went for the classic 'Bad Guys Whacked In The Face' type. There is no gore or extreme violence in this, everything has a light-hearted touch to it and the flubber truly seems fun to play with.Robin does do a good job as the professor, making many wacky inventions and always forgetting. Weebo played by Jodi, continues to be the kind, thoughtful person - or in this case computer - that she is when she plays Ariel in the little mermaid.Overrall it's a pretty good film, not ideal for adults but then why get a kids film?",8
453,Flubber,"When I was young, this Walt Disney Pictures film used to be quite amusing, especially because I was a big fan of Robin Williams after what I saw in Aladdin and Mrs. Doubtfire, and it is still a pleasant film. Williams plays the really absent minded Professor Philip Brainard. He has tried two times before to marry his love, Dr. Sara Jean Reynolds (Marcia Gay Harden), but he fails for a third time. The reason, because he has invented a living green chemical thing. It lives, it flies and it is like rubber, so he names it Flubber. He tries to win Sara's heart back by proving his new discovery works and can save the college from closing. Also starring Christopher McDonald as the mean Wilson Croft, Raymond J. Barry as Chester Hoenicker, Clancy Brown as Smith and Ted Levine as Wesson.. The special effects are great, Williams is amusing and the comedy is fun for the kids and adults together. Worth watching!",5
454,Good,"Flubber - Uma Invenção Desmiolada is brilliant and relaxed from the 1961 remake of The Fantastic Superman! Phillip Brainard (Robin Williams) is a badly awkward inventor and tries everything to reconcile with his fiancee and save the city college, even though it's a movie it's not a big deal anymore it's good ... I don't understand Rotten Tomatoes put 15% approval of the film is good and I recommend watching it with your family will bring nostalgia and laughter.",7

468,Roller-coaster of emotions,"This movie has one of the best acting I've seen on-screen since a big while and it was certainly a very welcome surprise coming from newcomers! They even manage to get you crying at the cheesiest lines. This movie is that depiction of true love that gets you through roller- coaster of emotions, loads of bawling (keeping a tissue box nearby is recommended!) and gives you hope that talented people like them still exist in Bollywood! The characters of the leads also seemed to be inspired from the Beauty and Beast pair; with the guy as the ""Beast"" type - emotions hidden inside and tough-looking outside, and the girl as the ""Beauty"" type- the intellect with the hidden virgin beauty. I do not agree with the Aashiqui comparison though because this movie got me crying whilst Aashiqui didn't as such but then that's my personal experience. This is very under-rated!! I highly recommend this; make it a must-watch ^^ ~",10
469,"Excellent Acting, Heart Touching Movie","I don't review Hindi movies as much but this movie had a compelling charm... First of all, the lead actors: Both of them did their job splendidly. They were new to Bollywood but I must say that they looked to professional to be in their debut movie. Mawra Hocane in not just a piece of beauty but an excellent outstanding actress. She put all her emotions to bring the character of Saru to life. Period. Same goes for the male actor. Music had sweet melody had its own charm in the movie. I don't remember any other movie after Ashqui 2 that had such an emotional music composition that was exactly describing the scenarios. Of course Ashqui 2 is better than STK but still this movie has its own charm. Story-line was predictable but still one can't lose interest once you start watching, nonetheless you are a hater and want to snitch out all the bad points from this. Most probably you would find some. But for me I didn't waste my 2:30 hours as some would say they did. I highly recommend you this movie...",10
470,"The love, true love.","The movie which can make any one weep, the movie which hits the hurt, the movie which shows the love.

The acting is superb.Let us hope that Indian Cinema would love this movie, and give it the respect which it deserves.The movie shows that the love has pain.

472,NOT JUST A MOVIE,"Its not just a movie, its the most romantic poetry as a movie. Romance worth watching. A story that hooks you up till the end. A sweet pain of climax that brings out the tears. Must watch for those who say they don't shed a tear during a movie.
MUST WATCH.",9
473,very beautiful people,"I am not a deadbeat fan of overly emotional movies. But this one was successful in keeping me nailed to the seat till the end. These young new faces are beautiful and good at acting. I wish I could cuddle with them sometime in an awesome threesome (only if they are up for it ; ). I have come to point in life where I could say that its wonderful to watch these young lovers and their drama on the screen. I wish I could see this movie alone, once and for all weep my ass out of the burden of being involved in a love triangle as in Inder, Sarasota, abhimanyu. Letting go of your girlfriend because of pressure from parents and traditions can be painful too :'((. Theater is not the place where I would want to embarrass myself with tears. But it would be a wonderful catharsis if one could watch it and let it all out.",10
474,Absolute delight..,"From the very start, you know this movie is something other than the regular Bollywood story.
The story, music, background scores, performances everything is to the point.
I don't remember if any other movie actor has spoken that South Indian accent so natural like Saru's father does. Every single performance is up to the mark no matter how small the role is.
Music and lyrics are cherry on the cake.
Both lead actors best suit the role.
Murali Sharma (the inspector), Sudesh Berry (Inder's father) , Manish Choudhary (Saru's father) all do fab jobs in their roles.
A loveable watch.",10
475,One of those underrated movies. *Must Watch*,"One of those underrated movies. *Must Watch*The only reason why this movie didn't do well on box office is because of the stupid stuck up people who prefers actor/actress over a good movie. I personally loved the movie/acting/casting/songs etc. I wish people would watch and then decide. The movie shares kinds the same name with Sanam re(that movie sucked as) If this same movie was done by some famous actor, then it would have been guaranteed hit for sure. A definite must watch movie for the romance genre lovers. So go watch, you will love it. Have fun!10/10 from me. Totally loved it. You will love it too.",10
476,Emotional roller coaster,"Sanam Teri Kasam is story a girl told by a man who fall in love with her on very first side .This film got every thing music and concept of beauty and the beast . Inder's bad Beastly Image with soft heart who living alone like punishment of undone crime and Saru's innocent Beauty broke the spell . Off course, We love the concept of 2 opposite characters change for each other and fall in love . Mainly its story of Saru , a simple old school, good , innocent girl who became problem for family when its come to her marriage. She is a biggest hurdle for her younger sister's wedding because no one want to marry Saru . First hour of the film is emotional inner journey of Saru who trying really hard to change herself so some one can marry her . She meet her neighbor bad guy imaged Inder and his bad repute kid of rub on her and she got in trouble and his father disown her which bring 2 character Indar and Saru together Now question is this a 21 century films then yes we still have live in society which holds old school value .It portrait a class that still stick to culture and values strictly in 21 century.If you think in this century a daughters marriage is not a problem for parents then you living inside your head.especially when girl is simple and old school . In every age and time we have character like Saur who find their selves misfit and rejected by people . I am sure there will be many viewer who can relate to Saru . Marwa Husaan shows a potential of very promising big screen actress but hats off to Harshvardhan Rane because second half is his performance and he held audience on a emotional roller coaster . His expression and delivery both is beyond excellent in second half . you wont be able to dry your eyes .",8
477,One of the best movies starring new actors,"This movie was dramatic, full of emotions, a true to the heart love story that made my eyes tear even at the cheesiest lines. Sanam Teri Kasam brought tears to my eyes throughout its plot and the actors did an amazing job portraying the characters emotions. They found the depth necessary in showing the true pain the characters were feeling. The best portrayal of this was the at Saru's death bed when she asked Inder to say ""bye"" to her. At this point I couldn't get my tears to stop. This is how you know that actors are truly good because they can make the audience feel true pain for the characters. For new comers into Bollywood I didn't think they would be that good but after a few minutes into the movie, Marwa and Harshvardan proved me wrong. I loved the music, the characters, and the plot line and with all three aspects, this seemed like the perfect Indian romantic movie that could stand a comparison with other romantic movies we love.",10
478,Emotional movie,"This movie is totally dramatic, funny, emotional, little cheesy with a bit of ups and downs! This movie will make you cry at some or the other point with some emotional dialogues and scenes. Murli Sharma who plays the role of Inspector was the best part in this movie. Mawra Hocane aka Saru played a beautiful role, from being dramatic to funny to emotional. Harshvardhan Rane aka Inder he played his role well. This movie is totally for the lovers (who are truly in love) and not for the action lovers. Overall this movie is full of drama, emotions and LOVE which will make you all teary! True Lovers should actually go for this movie.",8
479,"better then Dilwale, PRDP, HNY etc","This movie is nothing great, but compared to shitty multi millionaire movies like Dilwale, PRDP, HNY, this movie is great.The script could have been better rather than adapting a safe passage of romantic movies. the audience taste is changing and so the filmmakers should change the presentation.Acting is good, Music is good. Few glitches but can be given a good rating for the movie execution and acting.Few scenes where you will feel sad and get teary eyed (if Very Soft hearted person), u feel bad for the girl's character. Mawra and Harsh have played the roles brilliantly.",7
480,Romance worth watching,"I usually don't watch Indian movies but my mom was very persistent. It was probably the best thing I got dragged into watching. The movie overall was phenomenal. I absolutely loved it and would recommend everyone to go watch it. It will have you crying for days. The songs on the movie are very good as well. Its super adorable and dorky and I might take my boyfriend to watch it again. The actors played there roles really well and the dude was smoking hot, his body it to die for. It does have subtitles cause I don't understand Hindi that well so that was a big help. Recently all the Indian movies that have been released weren't that good in plot they all got very repetitive. It's good to see something a bit different in Sanam Teri Kasam. GO WATCH IT SO WORTH THE TIME AND MONEY!",10
481,very romantic..!,The best thing about this film is acting..now a days in Bollywood there is lacking of good actor...only looks cant give what a film need..So here in this movie both Harshvardan and Mawra done excellent acting...story is average..but story contains lots of emotion and actors did their best to portray the emotional sequence very well..And good music is the strong point.Last 20 minutes is little slow...seems like never ending..could have done more perfection to bring more genuine emotion to the last scene and melt strong hearted people also..overall a very good film..and best debut by both talented actors...worth watching..!,6
482,best love movie,"If you have been in love you will enjoy every scene of this movie, with tears with smile and for sure you will love the two main artists..the songs are too good..this movie is an evergreen movie..and the actress is very very good in her performance.",10

Pure acting pure emotion pure relation.....
If you love to watching romantic movies
Then must watch................. 😍😍😍😍😍",8
485,A heart warming story!!,"This is so far the best romantic movie in 2015 from bollywood! Though the plot is expectable....the performances delivered by the actors is marvelous. The two lead roles are new comers but the truly showed their talent...I was really attracted towards their acting. The movie is well crafted and well directed. Kudos to the director for giving us such a great romantic story. The movie shows the importance of relations...the relation between a father and his daughter. This movie also tells us that we should be believe in our loved ones and never to judge them based on other peoples' sayings... The most important thing the dialogue which was told by the female lead is really coool!!! So, if any one is looking for good if not good better than good family entertainer than I would suggest them to watch this movie!!!",8
486,Sanam Teri kasam! A movie that leaves you teary eyed,"Saraswati (Mawra Hocane) delivered a powerhouse performance in this movie.Sanam Teri kasam talks about love and it's associated pain. You can't see this movie from beginning to end without being sentimental and emotional...
This is one of the best movies to come out if India in 2016, I was shocked by it's performance at the box office, anyways, people don't really value good things.Good works from all the casts, directors, and crews.Jai Hind.",10
487,Hearttouching and Emotional.,"Out of all heart touching and emotional love stories, I found this one to be really very much touching. The performances were splendid. And the storyline itself is a gem. From dad son emotion to acting upon somebody's loss everything went like a rolar coaster ride. I personally loved it so would highly recommend it. Do give it a watch.",9
488,Masterpiece,What a Film i am addicted of the songs of this movie. The first Half is little bit slow but the second half Outstanding The Background score was amazing don't forget to watch this movie. One of the Best Romantic Film of Bollywood.,8
489,One of the Intense and Emotional Movie of Bollywood,"Sanam Teri Kasam is an intense love story of two diametrically opposite people; Saraswathy Parthsarthy aka Saru (Mawra Hocane), a Tamilian Brahmin and her wealthy neighbour Inder (Harshwardhan Rane). While Saru is a bespectacled plain Jane, who works in a library, Inder is a cynical rebel who lives life in the fast lane.Leading a sheltered life, under the aegis of her strict disciplinarian father, her marriage is the biggest bone of contention in her family as she is always rejected owing to her dowdy appearance and staid personality. One day, in her desperate attempt to transform herself, Saru inadvertently changes her destiny.With a well-written screenplay and powerful performances by the debutant duo in Bollywood, the film tugs at your emotional chords and makes you empathize with Saru and her plight. Their love story is credible and their on screen chemistry is strong and tangible.The dialogues befitting the characters who mouth them, are not the regular clichés in a love story and offer depth to the narration.Harshvardhan Rane as Inder, delivers a controlled and poised performance, giving vent to his angst, love, frustrations and sorrow with restraint. He lights up the screen with his strong and well-chiselled physique and emotes superbly through his eyes. He is equally at ease as the silent lover, as he is in an emotional outburst.Mawra Hocane, the Pakistani VJ, model and actor, is a delight to watch as Saru. She slips into the demure character with ease and her get-up certainly adds to her persona. She is confident and her innocence is endearing. You are one with her in her unrequited love, as also in her hour of grief.Manish Choudhari as Saru's stern father essays his role competently and brings alive the character of the Tamil Brahmin authoritarian patriarch on screen. Murli Sharma as the policeman who is a sucker for love stories performs well too. Anurag Sinha as Abhimanyu Shastry, Saru's colleague and crush, offers a sincere portrayal.The powerful background score is apt and uplifts the tenor of the scenes. The music by Himesh Reshammiya is soulful and one of the highlights of the film. The songs are penned well and bring out the mood of the film, especially Haal-e-dil and Bewajaah. The only unwarranted song is perhaps the one picturised on Vijay Raaz.With brilliant production values, Sanam Teri Kasam manages to draw you into the lives of Saru and Inder and moistens your eyes too.Perhaps it is the last fifteen minutes of the film, which drags a bit and given the few cinematic liberties that the directors have taken, becomes a little mawkish. Else, theirs is a love story that will touch your heart without a doubt.",10
490,A saga of unconditional love with pure emotions,"A story which will make u feel emotional and will make u cry each and every minute.A good background music, tremendous acting and mind-blowing direction that will make u love Ur loved ones more than before.I love this movie and I m damn sure u will. A big hatsoff to 'Sanam Teri kasam '...",9
491,This story depicts that even beautiful women face hardships.. Heart Melting .,"I loved the way they have shown the struggles of a woman who is as beautiful as an angel, yet no-one sees the beauty of her nature and heart; bound by family and values; grounded like. Inder (HarshVardhan Rane) is the perfect depiction of a man that every girl would dream of- Loving, Intense, Protective, Caring. Many such movies are needed in today's time to teach us what love really is. Its more about keeping the needs of the person you love before yours. People must watch this if they know the true meaning of love. This movie has struck the chords of our hearts. Excellent work by Mawra and Harsh. You both have intense chemistry on screen. Kudos to the entire team. Good Luck.",10
492,ANTHRAX 2001,"I think the film was quite well done.  It couldn't have been done at a better time.  With the way things are in the world today, we could all learn some valuable lessons from this film.  If we just take notice and stop and think before we jump to conclusions, things could be a lot better.",7
493,Absolutely worst Spanish movie ever,"As I work in the Spanish movie industry I got a ticket for the premiere screening of ""Plauto"", which doesn't excuse my bad choice of ever having bothered to see the movie, yet gives the reason for it. Having said that I cannot comment on the story as such as it was virtually non existent, I still do not know what is was all about. So artistically speaking crap direction, acting etc. Technically speaking the worst lightning, color grading, camera work, special effects, well actually all you could do wrong with a film is accomplished to its worst in this flick. Do not bother seeing it. Watch any film, any, and you won't be as disappointed as watching this piece of... P.S The worst ever video to film pull-up ever done. So it's not even 35 mil we are talking about.",1
494,It's about what you're expecting.,"What you're promised: a group of roller derby girls and a few guys crash at a abandoned, haunted insane asylum. Oooh, creepy.What you get: many shots of girls wearing very little clothing, a killer ghost, and quite a few scenes of people walking down hallways in an abandoned building. Also, a bit of digging around in old filing cabinets, scanning documents that say ""CLASSIFIED"".Does it live up to the promises? Sure. Some of the girls even put on Rollerblades. There's a bit of hurried exposition that explains the mystery of the haunted asylum, but I wasn't paying enough attention, so I never really learned what was going on. It doesn't bother me. I can live without knowing the secret of this nameless asylum.This was a pretty generic movie. The acting was pretty decent, even good at times, but the writing and directing never impressed me. It's not like it was especially bad or anything, but they never went anywhere more creative or interesting than your average haunted house movie. Along with the lack of atmosphere or tension, that makes for a bit of a lame horror movie. While exploitative in nature, this movie is curiously inhibited, with no real gratuitous nudity or gore, though there's a voyeuristic strip scene and a few quick shots of mutilated corpses. So, in the end, I'm left wondering to whom this movie was intended. It's not gratuitous enough for exploitation fans, and it's too tame for horror fans. The leads are obviously too old (mid-to-late 20s) to appeal to teenagers, and it doesn't seem to work very well as a mystery, either. Does that mean it's a bad movie? No, certainly not. But that does keep it from being very memorable. It can't hurt to watch this movie, if you find it on a streaming service, like Netflix, but I wouldn't actually waste the time otherwise.",5
495,DEATH TO THE DIAMOND DIVAS,"The credits roll with an alternative music sound track (REM type music). The movie has that 70's slasher feel to it. A van full of roller derby babes and a few guys are traveling in the Pacific NW when they come across a wreaked car. They pick up the young couple (never old people) and head down the road only to find a gate/fence is crossing the highway. The group jumps the fence only to find the proverbial abandoned mental institution (where bad things used to happen) out in the middle of zero bars on my cell phone country. Sarah ""Crash"" smashes a window with her aluminum baseball bat because she decides they might as well spend the night there as they can't all sleep in the van which BTW is very low on gas. They quickly discover they are not alone, there is a psycho there named Roxy who tries to kill Crash, then cowers in fright. As the group tries to figure out what is going on, they foolishly separate etc. etc.Some nice legs in shorts roller skate around. Movie drops the f-bomb, has brief simulated oral sex, and no nudity.Not the worse horror movie out there. If you want to do a theme horror movie night of abandoned mental institutions, you might use this one as a warm up.",5
496,Room 33 leaves me wondering.,"What exactly was this movie about? How is it that a lunatic can project a demonic father figure into reality to kill people by smudging their eyes out with goo? (I know it was supposed to be an effect of tearing eyes out but it really looked more like a smudging to me.) The ""monster"" in this movie was really rather annoying and came off like some sort of ""euro-trash-thug-demon"" more than a scary supernatural presence. How exactly a former government LSD scientist became this ghastly presence in the old hospital is beyond my comprehension, or perhaps it just wasn't clearly stated in the story? I liked the main cast being a roller derby team of smokin' chicks, the fact that none of them show any skin is a little weak. They couldn't even deliver the cheap thrills in this plot hole ridden flick. I just kept watching in the hopes that the story would eventually make some sense, but alas, no such luck.",3
497,Waste-of-time independent horror with a clichéd asylum setting,"The only surprising thing about this laughable no-budget horror film is the praise it has received online. Having just finished watching it, I can report that ROOM 33 is a completely forgettable independent film in which yet another group of teenagers visit a supposedly haunted asylum in order to investigate it. Once there they discover a frightened girl and a mysterious killer with his sights set on them.Everything about this film is cheap and predictable and it doesn't even utilise the popular found footage angle to provide an excuse for the cheapness of the filming style. The script is non-existent, the acting very bad, and the attempts at horror more laughable than frightening. ROOM 33 is just yet another asylum-themed waste of time horror film.",3
498,Better than expected,"Although clearly low-budget and with some poor camera work and a cast of young actors who could do with a few pointers to say the least, this film was surprisingly entertaining with a few good scares despite the limited and rather basic 'special effects', consisting almost exclusively of blood on and around the eyes In a pretty sad attempt to make It appear that the eyes have been removed. Nevertheless, the movie Is lively enough to keep the viewer Interested and although the story and It's events are rather Clichéd It has It's fair share of scares and some Interesting characters - the skating, amazonian-like young lady with her baseball bat and In-your-face attitude Is someone I wouldn't like to upset! The general premise Is that a bunch of guys,late teens to early 20s,find themselves spending the night In an apparently abandoned and empty Psychiatric hospital about 80 miles from the nearest town and soon discover a weirded-out young woman with little to say and who Is obviously mentally disturbed. Murders soon ensue, the deaths seemingly caused by, or at least Including, the removal of the eyes of the victims. Some think the disturbed girl Is somehow Involved In the grisly deaths..... I don't think I'd watch It a second time but,all things considered, this Movie Is worth a watch, particularly for fans of Horror and suspense.",5
499,Room 33,"If you are a horror or suspense buff, this is a film you will surely recognise. A group of teens/teens-plus find themselves stranded miles from anywhere, but conveniently there is a deserted building just over the hill. This one is not a haunted house but a haunted something. There is one human denizen, a girl who is likewise haunted, not to mention terrified. She seems also to have a strange psychic connection with the villain of the piece, a black clad wraith who may not look quite like the Grim Reaper, but certainly acts like him.The only real question is how many of them will he dispatch before the riddle is solved? Actually, if you don't mind a proper resolution, this is not a bad film, certainly it is vastly superior to the common or garden slasher flick.",8
500,not Session Nine,"Room 33 (2009) is Directed by Edward Barbini , who also wrote it with Donnie Dale. Spoiler alert as I will be discussing plot points. First impression, Watchable but unintelligible. The longer it goes on the less sense it makes. The obvious set up, A group of mixed young people stranded overnight at a haunted, long abandoned Asylum. There they are terrorized by a stalking killer, and an abandoned young girl who haunts the vacant building. What makes this a bit different, and gives it it's twist? Unlike most teen victim films, here the girls in the group are tough as nails, roller derby brawlers. They are accompanied by their roadies and tech crew. Allie and Chad, played by Austin Highsmith and Chad Collins, are two unfortunates, stranded in the middle of nowhere, are happy to be picked up by the roller blade team, Sarah the leader of the pack is played by Nina Hausser. A nasty tempered loner. The group is well played and the dynamics are interesting. for a while. Then the plot gets in the way. Here there is not much of a plot , Rather the movie resorts to the standard set of clichés to take us to the inconclusive conclusion. The dark form running before the camera, accompanied by mysterious sound effect, has long since ceased being an effective jump scare. In this movie ""I'll find them"" is an overused phrase. Anytime there are group separations, and there are many, ""You stay here, I'll find them"" is put into play. Then there is the mysterious figure that disappears before the surveillance cameras. The Creepy girl who talks in voices, ""You are all going to die"" And so on. Production values are good, effects are minimal, It is the roundabout ending that is problematic. Here it is the writers who fumbled with the hit and miss plot points. In the end it did not really matter, just ride it through like a Roller blade session. Seven out of Ten, ""Mindless pleasure"" Stars",7
501,Worth watching,"Seemingly non-existent budget, lowest level movie. But. It looks professionally made, believable acting, not a bad script, usual plot though. I agree with another rater saying that it should be a 5.5.",6
502,Not bad....,"I did enjoy it to some degree. Started off with promise and somewhat interesting premise and characters but started going south there. The big reveal was a bit disappointing and there were too many gaping plot holes. For example, I initially enjoyed Nelson's character the most because he was entertaining and I thought his skittishness would keep him safe, but in one very uncharactistic act of bravado he confronts the demon ghost dad and gets killed. That was lazy plot work and a let down. We never get an explanation about why the boyfriend near the end was shot dead by the hillbilly guy. Or why Roxy's uncle was lurking around the asylum ruins alone in the middle of the night searching for her. And why did demon ghost want to kill his own brother (or if it was Roxy controlling him, why did she want her uncle killed)? And if Roxy was psychocitc and murdered her dad in the first place, why was her dad going around and murdering other people on her behalf, or was he just a projection from her mind as she herself said, and it was actually her murdering people? Certain things just did not make any sense. A few tweaks in the plot and story line could have produced a really good flick.",6
503,This is terrible.,"I'm a big fan of low-budget horror, but this is unwatchable. Every minute of it is stupid and tedious. Made by people who have watched many horror films but never understood the hows and whys of them. Clichés taken out of context... which actually is interesting from a sociolinguistic standpoint. Unfortunately I don't think experimental deconstruction was the intended point of the film.""When I was out there looking for Natasha, I saw something."" ""What did you see?"" ""I saw a guy in the road."" ""Well, why didn't you say something earlier?"" ""I JUST DIDN'T, ALRIGHT?!?""Etc.Etc.",1
504,Room 33,"Roller derby girls, their camera man and manager, along with a young couple they pick up, must spend the night at an abandoned mental institution when the group get lost on the way to a competition. Something evil lurks within(and on the outside)not to mention the gang come across a damaged, injured girl seemingly possessed and warning of a dangerous threat to them. Chad and Allie's car breaks down, lucky to find Stuart(the camera guy and techie)driving the van of roller derby girls.Chad admits to derby girl Barbie that Allie recently had a breakdown. Barbie has an obvious interest in Chad and doesn't exactly hide it, but he clearly feels awkward when she makes passes or uses insinuating statements. Sarah is the derby girl with a rotten attitude who spends most of her screen time cursing folks and tossing insults, mainly towards Allie. To Sarah, Allie's a ""know-it-all"" college girl with all the answers, clearly the type she harbors a dislike for. Anyone who even attempts to be reasonable with Sarah gets chewed out..Sarah considers herself quite a tough chick, with a mouth that reiterates this aggressive personality.Nelson is the token black guy of the group, and, as usual for a horror flick such as this, spends most of his time afraid, shivering and quivering in fear. Stuart is your typical pervert with a camera, and voyeuristic impulses towards the girls..he doesn't exactly shield the fact that his camera ""catches all the sweet spots"". Anyway, the killer of the film likes to gouge out the eyes of ""his"" victims, which we see in one case where the group find a camp with a slaughtered family..Roxie, the traumatized girl found by the group in the institution, has bloody hands which could implicate her as the human tool, a ""host organism"" so to speak, used by the evil spirit of a killer. There are a lot of horror movies, slashers and the like, which have long stretches where characters walk through large buildings, with many rooms, flashlight and a weapon of some sort in hands, seeking(or looking to protect themselves against)whatever can potentially harm them. ROOM 33 is no different in that it has plenty of investigation with the characters moving through corridors, down halls, in the basement, etc. Sarah, in roller derby gear, skates down floors pounding lockers with a baseball bat, skulking and angry(she has issues, no doubt, always at odds with Allie). You know that this institution has a disturbing history which produced the sinister specter appearing, disappearing, and reappearing at will anywhere he wants, and Allie, a pre-med student, will learn a little about the place and him. Roxie knows what she must do to possibly halt the madness and Allie will do whatever is in her power to save the girl. And, inevitably, poor Allie might just be the specter's next chosen vessel to inhabit.",4
505,A good try is lost among silly script ideas,"Some Roller Derby girls on their way to a match with their managers come across a broken down car and its occupants Allie (Highsmith) and Chad (Collins). When the van won't start the girls and the rag tag team of people discovers the only thing close by is an abandoned hospital that once was an insane asylum. They search the place and come across what seems to be a remaining patient named Roxy (Olivia Leigh) who seems crazy. When one of the members of the group turns up dead, Sarah (Hauser) thinks it is Roxy, but Allie doesn't and sticks up for her. The group is being stalked by a mysterious man in black with supernatural powers. This one is really all over the place when it didn't really have to be. Obviously low budget, the movie is full of weird characters and silly circumstances. Did they really need to be Roller Derby chicks? And did we really need to see no less than three of them try to escape the asylum on roller skates? This silly stuff is mixed in with a pretty straight forward approach by the film makers to at least try to make it scary. Some of the acting is really quite good but it is unfocused because of the weird wrappings of things like chicks wearing skates talking tough. This one tries hard but can't seem to get out of its own way and bring some real scares.",3
506,Genuinely not a good movie,"I can't honestly say that I like this movie, but there is something undeniably fascinating about it. This film features more roller skating than one would reasonably expect, unlikeable characters, poor writing (both in terms of advancing the plot and in sounding like how a person, any person, would ever speak), and sparks a general malaise in the audience bordering on schadenfreude at witnessing the truly dreadful denim pant options of the early-mid 2000s.So, I really can't say that I like it. I can say that in the past decade I have watched it at least four times and was at one point so obsessed with finding it without remembering the title that I spent four hours googling random descriptions and finally securing a copy on eBay. I take no pleasure in recommending anyone watch this movie, but I do recommend it.",8
507,Nifty little chiller,"A group of road trippers that includes two survivors of an automobile accident and an all-female roller derby team are forced to seek shelter at a dilapidated abandoned mental institution located deep in the woods. The group discover the frightened and enigmatic Roxy (a sturdy and sympathetic performance by Olivia Leigh) living on the premises. Moreover, a mysterious Man in Black (a genuinely creepy portrayal by Taras Los) starts picking folks off left and right. Director Edward Barbini, who also co-wrote the compelling script with Donnie Dale, relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, evokes a strong sense of decay, isolation, and vulnerability from the rundown remote setting, effectively creates and sustains a nicely spooky atmosphere that becomes more increasingly eerie and unsettling as the narrative unfolds, and provides a few cool bits of mild gore (the killer removes his victims' eyes). The sound acting from an attractive and capable cast helps a lot, with especially stand-out work by Nina Hauser as the snippy and angry Sarah, Austin Highsmith as the sweet Allie, Adam Key as resourceful and libidinous hipster Stewart, Kim Manning as the sassy Barbie San Juan, Nicole Dionne as the foxy Natasha, Chad Michael Collins as nice guy Chad, and Ace Gibson as antsy coach Nelson. Terence Pratt's crisp cinematography gives this picture an impressive polished look. Blair Anderson's shivery score hits the spine-tingling spot. The final explanation for what's going on is pretty sad and tragic. Worth a watch.",8
508,Interesting,"Harsh imdb scoreIs worth at least a 5.5
Has got a plot and follows the basic rules of a script that many pretentious author's one loose sometimesIt keeps it simple and it works
Does the job that is to entertain a publicLet's not forget that is at the end
An indipendent low budget movie so
👍",6
509,Boring Movie,"If you're here looking for a review for this movie, you most likely saw it as a $5 movie pack at your local Mart. This movie lacks gore. It also lacks tension and suspense. It really is a boring movie. There are hot chicks to arouse attention. But since there isn't any nudity, viewer will lose interest quick. Many deaths are off-screen. The few on screen deaths feature the killer running toward people sticking jelly into the eyes of his victims. I am serious. It really does look as if the killer is sticking jelly into peoples' eyes.Judging from a lot of the reviews, many people didn't learn what the secret of Room 33 was. I guess they were too bored or spent too much time fast forwarding to figure it out. And even if they did find out, would they care? No. This movie is unable to keep any viewer interested long enough to care.",1
510,Better than expected...,"When getting a movie by way of 4 pack usually holds minimal promise for good flicks. The feature of the bundle was curtains an 80's slasher film, which is good, but that's another review....This has a decent story with borderline good acting and hot bodies in little clothing. It's only downfall is the ghost, not at all scary or intimidating. It's like having your mail man as a villain.... Aside from that the film features roller derby chicks lost, with a dead car, and no cell service. They find themselves in an abandoned asylum, and they aren't alone. The end left some to be desired, but I enjoyed this movie, it's worth a try.",5
511,Interesting movie,Good movie to watch for especially the horror scenes and mystery in the movie the movie is not as bad as it expected the movie has some good direction.,3
512,I couldn't stop laughing,"This was a welcome change of pace, a film that was a bit independent and a bit mainstream, yet all in all, was still hilarious. With an unknown and unproven cast, this film captured a certain sense of zeal within a viewer, certainly making the viewer wish highway patrolmen were this funny and irregular all the time. Funny, even though the comedy was sometimes low brow, this film certainly earned its accolades at the Sundance Film Festival.",8
513,"Biting Satire of Cops, Drugs and Highway Mayhem! Awesome!","The ensemble cast in this film takes the just above average drug humor and turns it into a laugh festival. I rate this movie as funny as Animal House.The Local Highway Troopers are hapless, hopeless, and not anyone you want on YOUR highway, but man are they funny! You truly find yourself loving this crew as they struggle to keep their station open in the face of budget cuts.The characters are so widely diverse yet so believable from the ethnically questionable leader of the crew Arkot Ramathorne (Thorny) whose girlfriend runs a head shop to the adorable and insane Mack whose wild stunts steal the show on a regular basis.",10
514,Forget what that other guy says.,"Super Troopers LOOKS stupid but came through in the clutch with solid laughs from this comedy team.I'm not going to use some lame rating system like the other guy used but I will say this: IT IS BETTER THAN THOSE MOVIES HE MENTIONED.Super Troopers combines solid physical comedy with surprisingly solid comedy writing. Its by no means a classic, but it is very worth sitting around with some friends, smacking a few beers and checking out this flick.I was surprised by the hilarity of this movie, hopefully you will too.",8
515,Realistic Comedy Classic,"This movie was hysterical! The way they joked around with each other was so true to life! It wasn't unrealistic at all! Anybody who sees this will have to agree that there is at least one character in the film that reminds them of one of their buddies! I know it sure reminded me of the guys that hang around me! We just saw the movie this evening on IFC in widescreen, without commercials, and unedited. I am very happy I waited to see it this way instead of a TNT, TBS, USA, or FOX broadcast version. I am definitely getting this movie on DVD as soon as possible! The outtakes and behind the scenes features are probably fantastic!",10
516,One of the best comedies ever.,"Not many movies keep on getting better and better as you watch them for the 5th, 6th or 7th time, especially comedies. The first time I saw this movie in the Cinema it didn't blow me away, and most people I know who have seen this movie only once do not rate it very highly. After seeing it a few times I rate this movie as high as Fletch and other classic comedies, probably higher.There is so many worthwhile jokes that I think it must have taken quite a while to write - if you don't have a similar sense of humour you would probably think they had written it all in one night which clearly wasn't the case. There is not a lot to complain about with respect to the acting either - their style suits the movie perfectly.Remember that it is a comedy first and foremost - if you are looking for an clever story you have the wrong genre. Criticism of the movie being a series of sketches or jokes is really irrelevant - one look at the cover or preview tells you exactly what kind of movie it is. Regardless, there is nothing wrong with the plot and if you appreciate/comprehend the jokes the movie flows just fine.If you are going to watch it, watch it 2 or 3 times.",10
517,"""But our shenanigans are cheeky and fun! ""","I have a list of movies that, when airing on TV, I tend to get sucked into. ""Super Troopers"" is absolutely one of those. This thing's hysterical. It's sophomoric to the core, but it'd be a disservice to chalk it up to your run-of-the-mill immaturity. On paper, pretty much all of these jokes should fall flat; but this group of players is extremely well-suited to the material - which is really just a long series of memorable one-liners. And then they throw in Brian Cox and Danial von Bargen, and there's no weak link in this cast. But it's really the stupid things these guys resort to when they're bored. Sometimes I think we should all incorporate cat games into our everyday.I love this movie.8/10",8
518,Something Different,"You would think that a film about a group of state troopers trying to save their station from closing due to budget cuts would be old hat and cliched, and you probably would be right a small part of the time. In the case of this movie I think you'd be advised to put your expectations of a cliche filled film away and prepare yourself for a very funny, very off beat film that looks at things in a different way.The joy in this film is that everyone is very real and they handle things in ways that are for the most part not very movie like. The film was made by the Broken Lizard comedy troop and on screen they act and behave like they have been together for years and it shows. Their ways of handling situations are not restricted by movie-doms rules so while a good deal of what happens maybe sophomoric, its not stuff you've seen a thousand times, the opening way of handling drugged out speeders for example. Things don't always work perfectly, the pacing is off in places and some of the jokes fall flat, but if you want a good comedy thats not like a thousand others you've seen watch this flick.",8
519,A rave review for a great comedy,"Super Troopers?  Never heard of it. Then I saw it.  Then I hit play again and watched it twice in a row. Sitting in an Airbase in Turkey, I knew I had found what would be our number one ""cruise flick.""  The movie that all the officers of Fighting VAQ-134, could watch together, then spend the next few weeks quoting.   One guy even got a callsign, ""Farva.""  Perfect.  There is a lot of great material to chew on all through the movie.  The rivalry, pranks, and rookie bashing are things we cherish.  And we can all relate to having that one guy around who drives you crazy.  Many of my peers have already purchased the movie. And we have incorporated many of the quotes into our cinematically based lingo.My recommendation is to grab a bunch of friends, maybe some cold beverages, and have a good time.  You just may want to become a Highway Patrolman.",10
520,Littering and...,"The first time I saw this I swear I laughed so hard it hurt. Maybe it was just the perfect moment in time cause when I saw it the second time it was still good but not as good as the first. The third time I just liked it a lot and I still do. It reminds me of some 1970s-1980's comedies, most notably ""Used Cars"" and some of Bill Murray movies from that era. It has that same casual, we're-insignificant-and-enjoying-it, anti-establishment attitude that seems missing from contemporary comedies. Mix that tone w/drug use, rock music and sex and you get fun that blissfully feels twenty years old. Kudos to all involved, I raise the syrup and chug to thee. 8/10.",8
521,"Makes little sense, but very funny at times","'Super Troopers' has taken the 'Police Academy'-films and changed it into something funny. One of the differences is that the State Troopers in this movie want to be funny, things are not simply happening to them. The Troopers are Thorny (Jay Chandrasekhar), Mac (Steve Lemme), Foster (Paul Soter), a rookie named Rabbit (Erik Stolhanske) and the weird outsider Farva (Kevin Heffernan), all under the leadership of Capt. John O'Hagan (Brian Cox). The movie is set in Spurbury, Vermont where so little is happening they play games to have some fun. Their victims are the people they turn over. They also have a constant battle with the local police.There is a story, although it is more like a framework for gags. The Spurbury State Trooper department is about to be closed due financial problems. A dead body is found and it seems that there is a connection with some drugs, found in a truck. A great bust could help the Troopers. Of course the local police wants the same bust causing more problems between the two departments. A sub-plot involves Foster and a girl from the local police, Ursula (Marisa Coughlan), who are dating although that is against the rules. Of course Ursula might come in handy when it comes to who will solve the crime first, the Troopers or the local police.But like I said, the story does not really matter here. It is divided in funny segments, one a little funnier than the other, but all quite entertaining. Especially the verbal jokes dealing with some drivers they have pulled over will give you some great laughs. It is especially funny because at first we think the Troopers are just very dumb and talk in clichés. But then we learn that before they walk up to a car they decide which joke they will try, simply for their own amusement. Of course the movie goes over the top at some points, especially with the Farva-character, but it is not distracting because almost every comedy these days has a character like his.This may not be a great movie, but is an entertaining from start to finish. It made me want to see the other films from these comedians, their group is called ""Broken Lizard"", including 2004's 'Club Dread'. Since it is hard to top this movie at least in this particular genre, I am not sure whether I should, but that says enough about 'Super Troopers' itself.",7
522,"Strangely overhyped, and not funny.","I'll admit, word of mouth got me to watch this one.  And usually that's good, but this time it didn't work.  I only laughed once and smiled throughout.  Certainly isn't that funny.   The last good funny movie I watched was Rat.  Golfballs is better than this movie.  I didn't fully understand why it's got an R rating either.  So I would suppose that 1.  you have to be in the mood to watch below the belt humor, or 2. watch so few comedy's that this is actually good.I don't know if it would be better to watch the second time round, so I'll leave that as a question.3/10Quality: 0/10 Entertainment: 5/10 Replayable:  ?/10",3
523,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen,"A great film, with a good pace, lot's of great physical humor and good dialog. This film features terrific characters with the leads (the members of Broken Lizard) and supporting cast. It even has wonder woman (well, Linda Carter is in it at least. And she's still a babe.) The film is also visually interesting with good cinematography and excellent editing. There are great performances from all of the characters including the stoners, cops, and troopers.The plot centers around the antics of a bored group of state troopers who play around with the people they pull over, despite the fact they are about to be cut from the state budget. Good plot tension is added by there rivalry with the local cops and there fight over the territory. There are a number of great pranks, in addition to the good repartee between various characters.This is one of my favorite all time movies, and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It ranks up there with Rat Race, Caddy Shack, and perhaps even Animal House.",10
524,Meow THIS is what I call funny,"5 bumbling, prank loving Vermont State troopers need to shape up to avoid being out of the job due to the rival police department of the same town as they reside in. This small film is hilarious and single handedly put the Broken Lizard comedy troupe on the map and rightfully so as the film is highly quotable, extremely re-watchable and the comic timing of everyone involved is simply remarkable. Sadly, their next movie ""Club Dread"" wouldn't be nearly as great as this one is. If you ever find that any of your friends that don't laugh at this film then it's really time to get some new friends meow.Eye Candy: Maria Tornberg gets topless (and again in the Deleted scenes section of the DVD extras) My Grade: A DVD Extras: Commentary with director Jay Chandrasekhar and and actor Erik Stolhanske; Second commentary by actors Kevin Heffermen, Steve Lemme and Paul Soter; 6 minute Making Of featurette; 2 minute 'Road trip Newsrap' featurette; 14 outtakes & extended Scenes with optional commentary; Theatrical trailer; and Trailer for ""Kung Pow: Enter he Fist""",8
525,"What you'd get if you put any Farelly Brothers movie, and The Naked Gun in a blender.","If you try to picture that, you'll understand what kind of movie you're getting when you watch this hilarious movie. This is one, that will actually require a second viewing after wards, either because you're laughing so hard, or you don't get most of the jokes. If you don't understand it the first time around, please watch it again. There are a LOT of jokes and gags here, most of them are fall-on-the-floor funny, and even if you don't get it, the movie will still make you smile. I think this is the perfect movie to watch on a bad day. It will cheer you up instantly.The film follows the ridiculously stupid antics of a team of five Vermont State Troopers, Thorny, Farva, Mac, Foster, and Rabbit, none of whom would really qualify for a bronze medal in the special Olympics (as far as police work goes). These cops' idea of a good time involves playing bizarre, often rude mind games with the speeders they pull over (such as, trying to substitute as many words as possible with the word ""meow,"" and repeating each other's lines), and chugging bottles of maple syrup in the nearby diner. The state cops and the local cops are rivals, and if the contest was for sanity, the locals would win in a landslide. The mayor is threatening to shut down the state troopers precinct, and when a murder that somehow involves drugs occurs on the highway, the inept highway patrolmen find this as a last ditch effort to save their jobs. Yep, the plot highly resembles something from The Naked Gun, and while the film isn't as great as that, the laughs are nearly just as consistent. Once you see the movie for the third time, you will need to pause the movie occasionally in order to let out all your laughter from the last hysterical gag, and prepare yourself for the next one, which will of course, come probably as soon as you hit the play button. The actors who play the five troopers are all really talented unknowns (especially the guy who plays Farva), and they should all get more starring roles. These guys really know how to make you laugh your ass off, and the fact that they manage to keep the straightest faces imaginable while doing it is priceless. These guys need more recognition, because as long as these guys aren't acting, lots of talent is going to waste. This film really makes me want to see the other Broken Lizard movie, Club Dread, just so I can see these guys in action again. The scenery in the film is just plain gorgeous, with the beautiful green New England look. It's a happy setting, that totally sets a mood of impending hilarity. From the hysterical opening sequence involving some stoned teenagers and littering, you'll need to duct tape your sides together to avoid splitting. Quoting another review, this film may seriously impair your ability to keep a straight face while speaking to a state trooper. I couldn't agree more. This hilarious film receives an 8/10. Please watch it again if it isn't hilarious to you the first time.Super Troopers is proudly rated R for Language, Sexual Content, and Drug Use. Sex: 8/10 Violence: 5/10 Swearing: 10/10 Drugs: 7/10",8
526,Funny AF,I like the pranks they play on each other and unsuspecting motorists,10
527,Watch it with some buddies,"To be honest, it was so long ago when I watched this movie, I really don't remember many details. I just remember laughing hard. That is what I am basing my rating on. I really don't know if it would hold up to a viewing today, because I haven't liked anything else they've done, but I really don't have a desire to watch it again. I'll give it a seven and say it's worth a watch.",7
528,Super Troopers: 2/10,"If there's ever a movie that people say isn't as bad as it looks or what critics say, don't agree with them. That's what I did with Super Troopers. It's a misguided non tour-de-farce that has no idea where it's going. In fact, to make the obligatory pun, this movie could be called Super Poopers, since that's what this movie basically is and what most of the `jokes' consist of.The slim-to-none plot is about highway patrolmen who like to mess with the people they pull over. However, the `evil' state police men are going to take over their highway (gasp!) so they must save it.The bad guys were all too clear-cut, not leaving any mystery or suspense for us to follow. Of course, my DVD player did go on the fritz twice, but I don't think I missed anything. In fact, I'm glad it did. There's so many things wrong, what should I begin with?First, I'll go with the non-jokes. In the beginning I may have chuckled around twice, but soon fell through a giant hole. There are constant drug and sex jokes that aren't funny. The slapstick wasn't even funny; I usually fall for that. It all seemed a bit too rushed and tried to throw in a meaningless plot instead of making this an `SNL-movie'. Personally, I think an idea like this would work better in variety show cases. The `one-joke' premise got wasted early on. Plus, the movie seemed to run out of steam in the end.I also thought that all of the swearing was added in to try to attract a larger audience; it certainly wasn't necessary and definitely seemed not to fit in. Too many characters were thrown in, just like all of the unoriginal movies like this. How are we supposed to keep them straight if we don't know anything about them?I didn't buy any of the chemistry between the troopers and the police; in fact, it was laughingly bad. Hey, just like the rest of the movie!My rating: 2/10Rated R for language, sexual content and drug use.",2
529,Classic,"This was a true comedy gem. Everything about it rocked. It has the real goofball humor but hopefully you'll notice the real subtle things in the movie that can even be more hiliarious. Buy this movie, and I am already lining up for Broken Lizards Club Dread.",10
530,"""Police Academy"" on a Low Budget","This is frat house humor moved to the cop house. A bunch of occasionally funny set pieces strung together by a plot not worth mentioning does not make a movie. The opening scene, in which our comic troupe of troopers stop a car of stoned-out kids, may be a hint on how one needs to view this film to enjoy it.",3
531,"Wow, This Movie Sucks!","Broken Lizard is not a genius. This is proof. This is a very bad movie. I'm not a fan of Reno 911, but Reno looks funny compared to this garbage.The plot is stupid. These out of control Highway patrol cops are scared that regular cops will control the highway. OH NO! The beginning scene with the potheads was the only scene in this movie that had a few laughs. The characters are all unlikeable. Brian Cox is here and looks like he's having a miserable time here.As for the comedy, does not work. Much ""comedy"" here is forced. I could not believe how much this sucked. I remained silent for the rest of this movie.This is another over-hyped independent movie like Napolean Dynamite that totally sucks. Everybody seems to ""like"" these movies. Is it because you really do or to follow the crowd and say you do. This is a perfect movie to test out your fake laughs, cause there are none here.The Last Word: Inane. Ignore the hype. This sucks. Spend your time doing your laundry or go to the gym. Watching this is a waste of your precious time.",1
532,UNFUNNY,I sat through this mess waiting for a funny moment and it never came. Just god awful. Totally unfunny. I wondered where they got so many unknown actors and later I found out that they are a comedy troupe called Broken Lizard. A complete waste of time. At the end they show outtakes and it appropriately ends with a vomiting scene. Why is a talented actor like Brian Cox in this piece of tripe?,1
533,Genuine poo.,"This isn't funny, well not past the 12 year old mark anyway. The ""jokes"" are lame, the plot goes no where, the movie dosen't come together probably, and whats worse its full of a bunch of no-name ""actors"" who obviously had nothing better to do.2/10",1
534,"Filmed theatre, nothing more.","""From Here to Eternity: The Musical"" flopped when it opened in London last year and it's easy to see why; this is a very 'American' show to get its world premiere in the West End. It's also something of a downer. (did British audiences really want to see a show that ends with the bombing of Pearl Harbour?), and frankly it's British cast were never really up to the task, (British actors doing American accents always seem to be below par). It also didn't boast any real stars, though both former pop idol Darius Campbell and Robert Lonsdale are more than adequate, and it's impossible to get the movie out of your mind. On the plus side, it's very well staged by Tamara Harvey and boasts an outstanding musical score by newcomer Stuart Brayson. With a better American cast it's the kind of show I can see doing very nicely on Broadway.",6
535,This was suppposed to be good,"As a hungarian movie watcher I am supposed to like this. Problem is, I don't, even though I really wanted to. 
At first my big problem was the main male actor's leather clothes - they looked stupid. But I could let that go, and even though I couldve done without the dance scene (and the sunglasses too) I let that one go as well. But in the end, the movie could not overcome script problems, and the love between our heroes was as shallow as the hero's personality.
I got really angry at the movie when there was animal abuse in it - if you have seen it you probably know what I mean...
In the end they put in just about every hollywood cliche the could think of, not that it made it any better. Still, I've seen worse.",6
536,First loss of unbeaten legend,"Most expensive hungarian movie of all time aspired to be a historic drama, but makers saved money on wrong point - this movie desperately need a history adviser.When I see cheap chinese $2 pocketwatch from alibaba in first scene I lost confidence, which was later confirmed by leather clothes and stupid looking sunglasses.
Also scenes from stables and racing shows zero knowledge of moviemakers - racehorses are always free in box stables, not tied in stands as in this movie, Kincsem could not start from starting gates because that was invented after her era and in Europe was introduced after WWII, good 60 years after this story...
Zero historic knowledge of moviemakers representing a chauvinistic scene, where the viewer throws the hungarian flag to the jockey. In era of 1870s he throw the flag from 1956...
Kincsem not ran against too many horses as movie shows, he usually ran against one or two rivals. He never ran so many Derbys as the movie shows, he ran only one, Austrian Derby.
In scene of selling a bill of exchange to Blaskovich was said that Kincsem won a million crowns. True fact is she won about 200 thousands during career, in time of the scene it may be about two thirds of that sum.
And finally, Blaskovich can't get a medal after win as in the scene where hungarian nobleman not bow his head in front of the Austrian Emperor but take a medal by hand and put it to the pocket... Unreal scene because medals are never used in horseracing and also Austrian Emperor never giving prizes in Baden Baden, Germany but moviemakers mismatching facts to shows their chauvinism.Makers of Kincsem take a two real names, Kincsem and Blaskovich, and stuck them with a stupid slimy story that's disgraceful to the real characters of Blaskovich and the family of von Oettingen, who in fact had nothing to do with Kincsem.
Real Blaskovich not auctioned Kincsem, not get her as a gift, he bred her in his own stud in Tapioszentmarton. He not lived with her, he not trained her. Kincsem was trained by english professional trainer Robert Hesp in his training stable in Göd, about 45 miles from Blaskovich castle in Tapioszentmarton.
Blaskovich was respected person in a racehorse owners society. He had friendly relationship with other owners and many of them traveled with him and Kincsem around the Europe and won a big gambles.Kincsem never will be a timeless movie like Phar Lap or Seabiscuit, which are the real stories presented in a believable way. Kincsem is not a historic movie, is not a sporting movie, real genre is fantasy.
With consideration of average acting performance it's a movie that will be forgotten in few years.",1
537,I don't get the love...,"This movie was very well-received in Hungary, but after the trailers I already knew that I won't pay for it. It just looked cheap without taste. The hype couldn't fool me. Tonight, when I saw it on HBO, I just... couldn't get it. 
How can people really like this film? It has such primitive angles and camerawork, like in a telenovella 10 years ago; a script is a hungarian fake historical soap opera; the costumes 'hungarosteampunk' or what - well, for the creativity I would give it a pass, if it didn't look soooo cheaaap, like made of plastik. The actors and actresses did what they could with the material, which of course couldn't be much.Maybe the love for this film comes from sentimental patriotism, I can't believe anyone could seriously appreciate this fim, who isn't hungarian. The patriotism of the movie is so cheap and foced it is ridiculous - just like the austrians fake mustache, who are obviously the parody of themselves
The only likeable charakter is the Horse, who is cool, because...horses are cool. You just can't mess up that one. Just everything else...",2
538,At least it had horses,"The camera work was nice, and horses looked good, actors were also decent. They butchered the style of the 19th century with the modern dance, music, and cheat tasteless ""today's jokes"". Music was also awful. Script was horrible very cliche and boring.The last dramatic scene was one of the worst I've ever seen.If you read 10/10 reviews most of them are fake , paid ones. Its a shame that they spend tax money on this..",2
539,Highest budget Hungarian movie ever,"Kincsem an expensive film by European standards and it does not look cheap. If you are a great movie fan and look for a great Hungarian movies, this may disappoint you, because ""Son of Saul"",""White God"", ""On Body and Soul"" won recently very high critical acclaim with a much lower budget, not to mention classics like ""Time Stands Still"". But ""Kincsem"" is not an art-house movie, it is suitable to any 16+ general audience.If you are looking for a romantic thriller with a racing horse, this film is good, probably worth a 6-7 star rating. If you want to watch something Hungary-related that is also entertaining, this is probably your best choice, and worth a 8-9 star rating. The racing scenes are great, the film is a bit unusually but well acted. The soundtrack is probably the weakest point, which alternating between original and bad (Hungarian) cliché.",6
540,"Undoubtedly, this has been the best Hungarian movie from the last ten years.","If you love horses, watch it. If you just want to see a movie that has a great story alloying drama and action, watch it. Not only is Kincsem a great horse movie but also represents accurately the underlying tension between the two countries in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. I particularly enjoyed the jokes, but I am aware that these were primarily created for the Hungarian viewers. No worries, this does not mean you lose a lot, and the exciting scenes along with the breathtaking landscapes are going to make you wish you could hop on a horse and ride off into the sunset. I would like to highlight the horse scenes which were amazingly detailed and seemed real. The story was well established and not predictable, the conversations and conflicts were exciting. Undoubtedly, this has been the best Hungarian movie from the last ten years.I highly recommend watching it.",10
541,Really?,"Wasted opportunity. With all the money to spend, somehow they choose Nagy Ervin to star. I mean... really? The guy is on the level of some provincial amateur actors. You don´t know if you should cry or laugh watching him. I would be embarrassed in his place. The music is a disaster. And all looks and feels cheap. Very disappointing.",5
542,Review Kincsem,"One Huge Star for the story! Another big one to Ervin Nagy, as a high level actor. The third star is to horse, Kincsem.And that's it.High budget movie and it looks very cheap! The cast was awful with few exceptions...But the main actress, Andrea Pertik was definitely the worst choice. (Thanks to her the romance factor was zero unfortunately)With this story...they would have been made a gorgeous movie!!! Feel disappointed.But again this critic is to the director and to the producer.....The only thing I enjoyed truly is the horse race and the performance of Ervin Nagy.",3
543,Motivation and new perspectives,"When the news appeared that ""Kincsem"" can be watched in the cinema, immediately made some clicks and booked my ticket in Budapest, Hungary. Unfortunately nobody had time or mood to come with me, which made me sad, but with the ""I gotta watch this movie"" thought I made my steps. Strange thing in a big city to watch an original movie alone, but in this way I got the opportunity to understand and interpret this amazing film in a unique way. Thank you producers and their whole team for the motivation! I let the speculations to the readers :)",10
544,The sound is terrible,The sound sound engineer is the worst all the time. The volume is loud and quiet in a sec. (In the Hungarian version.) The lighting technician is also bad but the original story is great.,5
545,The horse and the cat,"This is probably the best horse-racing film ever made, and it is based on a true story: the horse actually existed and won 54 races and was never beaten. The horse is the main character here, and the moment she is introduced you will follow her closely glued to the screen whenever she appears and triumphs in every scene, even when it becomes really critical. Around the horse is spun a romantic intrigue, a real romantic novel of forbidden love, revenge, horrible injustice, deep friendship turning into the opposite, despair and tragedy, and of course it's impossible to like or accept all of it. Ervin Nagy plays a hopeless character to begin with, but I could tolerate him when I found a close resemblance between him and king Ludwig II of Bavaria - the same kind of hopeless lack of judgement. His friend Tamas Keresztes makes a much more sympathetic and interesting character, while the girl Andrea Petrik, with her invalidity, adds plenty of spice to the show. To this comes the cat, which plays an enormously important role although saying nothing, not even miaowing, and constitutes perhaps the key to the story and saves it. This is a very spectacular film reminiscent above all of ""Anna Karenina"" with Keira Knightly, and the ballroom scenes must have been inspired from that film. But it's the horses that count. The one great portion of humour is presented by the one Englishman in the play, a jockey, whose introduction is perhaps the most unforgettable instance in the film - in bed. This is an adventure that will keep you alert and on the double in the horse-racing scenes.",9
546,Best Hungarian movie since a very long time....,"I truly consider that this movie is one of the best Hungarian movies of the last years. Theme is great ! Moments like the origin of ""the selfie"" is also funny Petrik Andrea singing Hungarian hit music also inventive.... Well detailed and good quality movie. Nagy Ervin was so suitable for this role and his acting wasn't forced .... which is from my point of view pretty rare when it comes to Hungarian movies...",10
547,Kincsem ...,"This film is really entertaining. The story, the races, the wonderful Hungarian landscapes - all are well made bricks of the great building of this movie.But the main parts are the relationships. 
Relationships between man and horse, man and his country, man and woman, man and dust, man and fate.Nagy Ervin and Petrik Andrea gives their best. Both of them are the best choice for their roles. They are not an actor nor an actress, but they are truly that man and that woman. And their love is so real and unforgettable.Thank you for all members of the staff for this 2 hours of fantastic experience.",10
548,"expected too much, so disappointed","I was totally disappointed after watching the movie. the technical side of the movie is brilliant, with so much of money, effort and resources involved the team could've made the film more worthwhile. The narration and storytelling of the movie is very vague, and I sincerely didn't feel or care for the characters. lot of scenes and dialogues felt so made up and pretentious, could have been better if more and more time was spend on kalaripayattu training sessions, and the dialogue delivery training. Editing could have covered up many more flaws in the movie. Visuals and vfx are totally brilliant, great looking cast(not equally brilliant with acting, but could've been lot lot better with time and patience, am sure they are talented), cinematography, music felt good.Too much expectation could break your heart. The theatrical edition i just watched is not worth the hype, effort, or the crew's reputation.",8
549,A daring attempt in Mollywood,"Jayaraj's ""Veeram"" is the adaptation of the Shakespearian tragedy ""Macbeth"" into the story of ""Chandu Chekavar"" from Kerala folklore. It is the costliest Malayalam movie till date. It stars Kunal Kapoor, Shivajith Nambiar, Himarsha Venkatsamy and Divina Thakur in lead roles. The director successfully uses the narrative of ""Macbeth"" to present the story of Chandu. The dialogues (in North Malabar slang) were brilliant. The cinematography is another highlight of the movie. The locations were visually appealing though they do not seem to match the description of Kerala in ""Vadakkan Pattukal"". The fight scenes involving the martial art ""Kalarippayattu"" were well choreographed. All lead actors had undergone training in the martial art for almost a year and it turned out to be critical in the perfection of fight sequences and the warrior-like body language of characters. But when it comes to acting, there are no exceptional performances to talk about.""Veeram"" never deviates from its track and the director was brave enough to exclude songs from the movie. It begins in the same way as ""Macbeth"". The reasons for Chandu's indignation towards Aaromal were not explored in this movie. It could have been done; considering that the movie is only about 100 minutes long. Yes; those are familiar to the Malayali audience but ""Veeram"" is a multilingual made on a larger canvas.In short, ""Veeram"" is a landmark in the history of Malayalam cinema. It is the work of a genius who connected the life of an anti-hero from the folklore of Kerala with that of another from a western world classic; both of whom were ambitious and brave but met with tragic ends.",8
550,Indian Macbeth is a feast for the eyes,"VEERAM tells an ancient Indian lore which bears resemblance to the story of Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"".The movie substantially follows the same plot, even quoting nearly verbatim what is the perhaps most famous quote of that play (""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""). The setting, however, is in ancient India and the context provides a window into ancient Indian culture.The movie is a visual spectacle: the cinematography, production design, costume design and fight choreography are all first-rate. It is a joy just to behold the gorgeous imagery which effectively evokes this ancient mystical culture of North Malabar, a region in southwest India.It was interesting also to learn about Kalari, an ancient martial art which is nearly 3000 years old, and watch well-choreographed fights involving the Urumi, a dangerous sword with a flexible, tape-like blade.Alas, the film is not perfect.Except for some of the main characters, including the antihero, most of the cast had a wooden delivery, which was amplified by the Indian accents of the actors.Also, the editing was at times too choppy; it made it sometimes harder to follow the events, especially for someone not familiar with ancient Indian culture,Nevertheless, this is a worthwhile film for anyone interested in Macbeth, ancient Indian culture or historical drama in general.",8
551,"unusual but impressive adaptation of ""Macbeth""","A group of trained fighters earn their money fighting duels on behalf of others, in order to settle disputes. (It's a living.) One of the more promising warriors, a young man called Chandu Chekavar, listens to an unexpected prophecy made by witches. Inspired by the prophecy, he aims to become first a lieutenant and then a commander. His bitterly determined lover spurs him on...""Veeram"" transposes the well-known tale of Macbeth to a long-ago India filled with unique mores and rituals. (Sadly, my ignorance of Indian history and culture is such that I find it difficult to evaluate the movie's balance between fact and imagination.) Textual purists are not going to like the many liberties taken with Shakespeare's text. However, ""Veeram"" remains faithful to the general architecture of the play. It also maintains the play's great themes of ambition, betrayal, remorse and retribution.It is a testimony to Shakespeare's brilliance that many of his lines remain as striking and chilling as ever, even when uttered by people in ancient Indian garb complete with elaborate face paint. Truly his was the kind of genius which transcends time and place.It's a vivid, colorful movie, a sensual and sensuous too. The camera seems to delight - more, to luxuriate - in beauty : the beauty of a temple wall caressed by the sun, but also the beauty of a well-muscled torso glistening with sweat or that of an exquisite nose adorned with a costly ring. There are also a number of surprisingly erotic love scenes. At least one of them made me fear for the safety of the actors, who were embracing while laden with pounds of silver jewelry. This could easily have resulted in a Gordian tangle of bracelets, earrings, tresses and anklets. The world-building is convincing, while the well-choreographed duels impress by their combination of ceremony and ferocity. The preliminary salutations alone constitute a spectacle.I got the impression that both Macbeths, if that's the correct term, changed rather quickly from cunning murderers into guilt-ridden wrecks, but that's a minor objection.Comes with a fine lead performance by Kunal Kapoor as Chandu Chekavar (Macbeth).",8
552,I give 5 stars... And all that's goes to the editor and cinematography 😍,I didn't expect this kind of worst direction from a craftsman like jayaraj... Great story great visuals but poor direction,5
553,Casting completely ruined the film for me,"I found it so difficult to sit through this movie. From the start, I just couldn't get into it.The acting was terrible, it was weird to see the dialogues coming from the actors' mouths. It was so obvious that they were not saying the dialogue. And there is practically no expression on the faces of the three main actors. Kunal Kapoor looks the part, but it felt very strange to hear him speaking the slang. I must say the dubbing artists have done a good job.The technical aspects were very good. While it is clear that it is green screen, it still looks good.Overall, I have rarely seen a movie brought down so much by the casting. With better casting, I think this movie could have been a commercial hit.",5
554,Surreal,"Just forget the Malayalam movie ""Oru Vadakkan Veeragaadha"" and then watch this movie as a modern day stage play captured on film. The cinematography is beyond words and gives a surreal experience along with the background music. The predictability of the story and the lack of drama element may disappoint a large group of viewers. Had the maker kept the connection of the movie with Macbeth, there would have been a surprise element which could have fixated the viewers till the end. The movie gives a better experience in movie theatre environment.",7
555,Bab bad movie will evil thoughts,Evil thoughts which cannot be thought by any living creature on this world. This is am attempt to demoralize and defame Indian traditions. Like is starting two evil women with evil wishes are shown meditating for evil results. Could not see it any more after this.,1
556,Rubbish,"I can't understand how this film is rated 9.2. The Lt Col looks like a German WWII Officer, the Major had long hair with an ill fitting beret and no cap badge. The Captain saluted them with no beret on, which doesn't happen and the rest of the soldiers were a shambles.The uniform that they are wearing is DPM jungle pattern, which is not worn in the UK. I don't even know what rifles they are using, certainly not British issue. The acting is so wooden and false, it's embarrassing.",1
557,Huge shame,"Like the other reviewers I was initially drawn by the fact that it had such a high rating on IMDb / Amazon Prime. Can I just say that although a lot of the acting was wooden, there were numerous holes in the plot and some awful continuity; the lead character played by Cengiz Dervis and Captain Chaloner (Dan Richardson)both actually did a good job. Technically for the main the camera work was good and so was the lighting but then that all went away for the main action scene.As this film was based on a novel, I really fail to see how somebody could lose track of the story line, which jumped around all over the place and to be honest left me very confused at times.Like other reviewers have said, the crew must have done some of the ratings as there is no way this film should be rated above 4. Better luck next time",4
558,biggest pile of pap I have ever seen,"I don't think I have ever written a review on IMDb before, that should tell you how passionate I am that any other prospective viewers of this film DO NOT waste their time doing so! The acting is wooden and the directing poor...Not even the dress of the actors or set was convincing! Please don't waste any time watching this, I am only glad it was a free Prime film on Amazon. If I had paid £ or it, I would be on the phone demanding a refund for 'taking money under false pretences'.",1
559,Interesting Welsh thriller on a tight budget,"BY ANY NAME is an interesting suspense thriller from Wales. It had an odd premise and an arresting start which sees a nude guy running through the streets, wounded and on the run from persons unknown. The film was made in the Brecon Beacons on a very low budget but that doesn't stop it from telling an engaging tale; with the right budget and properly-staged action scenes this could have been something very special. As it is, this film keeps you watching with decent acting and music that sets the mood pretty well. It's a bit too low key because of the budget but for what it is it's not bad at all.",5
560,Terrible film!,"How did this film get such good reviews? I can only assume the entire crew reviewed it ahead of the general public! The plot was awful, the acting was dire, the 'British Army uniform' was completely inaccurate - along with almost everything else in the film (what doctor is completely relaxed having been kidnapped by a supposed killer patient?!). We literally had our jaws on the floor as we watched it baffled by the high rating.",1
561,Low budget,"As others have said I watched this off the back of the rating. The film has clearly been made to a budget which reflects in the screenplay. Scenes and props are basic and the sound is poor. Given what the cast and director probably had to work with they have done a reasonable job. Some elements are unconvincing, I found it watchable but would not recommend it.",3
562,Utter utter crap,"Hammy acting, continuity issues, terrible plot, the worst film I have ever wasted time on, avoid its just totally totally awful..Uniforms all rubbishNo-one can actPlot is ridiculous",1
563,"Unfortunately, a pretty awful independent movie.","How did this movie score so highly on IMDb?I am a big fan of independent movies... Especially British ones. However, not wishing to slate the cast or the film-makers too harshly I feel I should leave a review as to warn others. In as few words as possible this film does not even come close to being rated as an 8??... (Which is how it was rated when I watched it).Please note the following points - This film has an awful script... (back of fag packet springs to mind).Followed by an awful dialogue... (even the subtitles were sub-standard!)Followed by some people who are credited as actors... Who barely interact... If at all?Enough said I think? There are some quite pleasant views of the countryside and the camera-work in the main is not too bad... Although I feel it would have been achievable by a twelve year old with a bad leg and possibly with a sprained wrist too.So, there you are if you're still game, please indulge yourself for an hour and a half, and then leave your own review!",2
564,Terrible,"Watched this on Amazon Prime. The premise promised much but the whole filming, acting, wardrobe, etc all wrong. The acting is terribly wooden and unconvincing, senior military officers in wrong uniforms and in need of a haircut. Weapons used seem to be whatever the production crew could get their hands on and do not reflect those actually deployed by the British Army. Continuity leaves a lot to be desired especially when a sergeant is fine one day, in an arm sling the next with no explanation then remarkably recovers in the next scene.No idea how this achieved such a high review and awards, that is an hour and a half I will never get back.",1
565,Why was this even made?,"One of the worst films I have ever witnessed. How has this even got a rating above 1? Nothing wrong with b movies but this is not even a Z movie. Who wasted their money funding this terrible film? Terrible wooden acting and terrible story line. They didn't even research anything to do with the military and everything is wrong. Worst of all the terrible doctor, who is this person? Most unconcerned medical person ever in a film, they need acting lessons before making anyone sit through their terrible acting again, even better give up acting altogether. Worst acting I have ever seen. Avoid like the plague.",1
566,An important episode in history obscured by a mediocre love story.,"Everyone knows about the Holocaust but few have even heard the word Holodomor. It means 'death by starvation' and it refers to the Ukrainian mass famine deliberately engineered by Joseph Stalin during 1932-33. Scholars label it as genocide and estimate between 7 and 10 million deaths were directly linked to Stalin's policy of de-populating the Ukraine. More accurate numbers are not available because long-standing Russian secrecy has only recently eased enough for the story to be told. The film Bitter Harvest (2017) is the first feature movie to tell this story using a dramatized romance that attempts to humanise a story of inhumanity.Set in 1930s Ukraine, the story commences with two young childhood sweethearts in the film's only joyful moments. It quickly moves to Joseph Stalin ordering a mass collectivisation program to confiscate the Ukrainian harvests so he could feed his armies. Most chillingly, he commandeers the grain seeds so famine was not only unavoidable but planned. As their village faces an impending catastrophe, the now grown-up young lovers, aspiring artist Yuri (Max Irons) and his betrothed Natalka (Samantha Barks), must separate as he goes off to join the anti-Bolsheviks in Kiev while she remains to care for her ailing mother. Yuri believes in the power of painting and music to tell the world what is happening but his art teachers in Kiev force him to use art for revolutionary propaganda. As Stalin's forces deplete Ukraine's rural food-stock, villagers are accused of hiding grain and seed and failing to support the revolution. Wherever food is not surrendered there are mass executions in front of mass graves, while others starve to death in their homes and on the streets. Yuri is captured and tortured, but escapes to be re-united with Natalka and they eventually flee to Poland.The detail of this love story pales against the bigger narrative of Stalinist atrocities. While it is a conventional cinematic device to convey a big story through a small lens, the relationship between the two is critical. The two stories of this film are out of balance and unevenly directed. The attempt to create an epic love story diminishes the magnitude of the Holodomor and almost glosses over the scale of its horrors. While the cinematography is excellent throughout, the acting is wooden, melodramatic, and lacks authenticity. The clean-faced good looks of the dual protagonists form a jarring contrast with the caricatures of the Stalinist scar-faced ogres who are depicted as pure evil. Turning archival images of starved bodies on streets and decimated corpses in mass graves into background props to tell a love story feels disrespectful. The film's lack of nuance and simplicity of narrative is a lost opportunity for insight into this dark episode of history.It is difficult to be critical of a film that deals with such important subject matter. In terms of the need for the bigger story to be told, this film should be rated highly but as cinema it is seriously flawed. On balance, the one and three-quarter hour investment to see this film is worth the time as it is the only available narrative film of life at the time of the Holodomor. As such, it is educational cinema that helps us understand contemporary Russian-Ukraine politics. However, the shelf-life of this film will be determined only by the time it takes for a better film to be produced.",6
567,Stalin- not Hitler for a welcome change,"The Communists starved the Ukrainians under Stalin. The New York Times via Walter Duranty, covered up their crimes. Bitter Harvest is a fictional action- drama based on one man's story that lived through it. Now, finally a movie that is not about Hitler (national socialism) but about the real threat America faces from the left- International socialism ( communism) - still being covered up by the same lying media. Walter Duranty is best known for his stringent denial of the genocide of the Ukrainian people, known as Holodomor. Duranty refused to report on the man-made famine that killed up to twelve million people. Duranty also claimed other journalists who reported the truth of the USSR, such as Malcolm Muggeridge and Gareth Jones, were liars. Muggeridge went on to call Duranty ""the greatest liar I have met in journalism."" Some of Duranty's most well known lies and falsehoods about Holodomor are: ""There is no famine or actual starvation nor is there likely to be."" --New York Times, Nov. 15, 1931, page 1 ""Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda."" --New York Times, August 23, 1933 ""Enemies and foreign critics can say what they please. Weaklings and despondents at home may groan under the burden, but the youth and strength of the Russian people is essentially at one with the Kremlin's program, believes it worthwhile and supports it, however hard be the sledding."" --New York Times, December 9, 1932, page 6 ""You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs."" --New York Times, May 14, 1933, page 18 ""There is no actual starvation or deaths from starvation but there is widespread mortality from diseases due to malnutrition."" --New York Times, March 31, 1933, page 13 Duranty also admitted privately that the genocide was happening. Bruce S. Thornton wrote: Walter Duranty stands as perhaps the quintessential fellow-traveler, killing news reports of famine and writing that Ukrainians were ""healthier and more cheerful"" than he had expected, and that markets were overflowing with food—this at the height of Stalin's slaughter of the kulaks.",9
568,"MUST SEE FILM, Bitter TRAGEDY","You MUST watch it, but It will not be easy to watch this movie.... historical facts and one of the first movies about this page of history.I watched this movie in cinema... Noone jew popcorn, people cryied...
The movie makes you rethink and hunger to learn more about real history, a tragedy previously unknown nobody, until 1991 it was forbidden to talk about it and after many people were afraid, they could not believe USSR and Stalin regime finnished.Director of the film made a great job, based on successful history of his family... to survive! And only God knows... the real number of death only in 1932-33, from 20 to 40 mln... dead and halfalive bodies were collected in villages of Ukraine and thrown in one big pit, where people were still half alive... hard to imagiine. The bread / wheat from ukrainian villages/cities were collected and taken to Moscow from where Stalin sold it out all over the globe, while Ukrainians had 0 seed to eat.Now this must be shown in every school of the world. The tragedy must be told. We all hope nothing common will be repeated at any other point of the globe... but we still have some countries.... living in regimen where flow out of information is impossible.",10
569,Great movie about Holodomer,"I was introduced to Holodomer lately in 2019 by an event in my library in San Francisco, I was blown away by the mass murder of Ukrianians when I saw a documentary about Holodomer. I am so glad that I saw this movie Bitter Harvest. It opened my eyes to the cruelty in this world and what people had to sacrifice for freedom. We should be thankful for the freedom we enjoy in this world. For some people it is hard indeed. Please watch this film and educate yourself and read more about Holodomer.",10

SO MANY FILMS ABOUT IT AND EXHIBITIONS.However, The Biggest TRAGEDY in a history is HOLODOMOR that took place in last century in Ukraine. And until now there are not so many films or museums exhibitions yet.This STORY is based on Director Family story where they got luck to run away from the hell. I expect new wave of films about this and as well I hope nothing like that would never happen at any corner of the planet...",10
571,Heavy handed direction kills it,"1930's Ukraine. Genocide through starvation. It was never going to be a pleasant story. It's tough to make a film out of something so one sided and something so horrific. And at times its difficult to sit through. Yes it's violent but we don't see a lot of it up close. It's not gratuitous. It's already dire enough. Yet there's plenty to be depressed about.The story itself is quite good. Following the journey of one character so we get an overview of what happened in varying parts of Ukraine during this time. And yet it's a stretch. Certain scenarios are just asking us to suspend belief a little too far. Our central figures should have been killed several times over. Knowing this is set within real events (though not of these characters) keeps us involved. But only just.The problem is with the director. The early scenes are so over-lit it makes you feel like you're watching a Disney TV play. The clichés come thick and fast through the staging and unfortunately some of the dialog too. The direction is heavy handed, falling back on triteness such as blood dripping from a sword stuck in the ground and other lame symbolism. It's all a bit overblown. The cinematography, the music. They wanted to make a real epic here but even at 100 minutes, it feels overlong and over-baked. It's horrific to be certain and I wanted to care more but the central story just doesn't grab us the way it should. Terence Stamp adds an element of acting class. Shame that it can't be said for the rest of the cast. For example, Stalin is a caricature. Hours after seeing it, I'm already beginning to forget it. And that's not a bad thing.An event this huge deserves so much more.",6
572,"To understand the present, need to know the past","The Holodomor in Ukraine, the genocidal famine planned by Stalin and his commissars that killed millions in 1932-33, was a Soviet policy of forced starvation and is a cruel little known period in the history of the 20th century. Maybe it was too optimistic to try and cover the fall of the Russian czar, WW1, the Bolshevik/Russian revolution, the death of Lenin and the rise of Stalin and the genocidal famine in Ukraine, in 100 minutes. And then make all the horror of that period less terrible with a hopeful love story. Too much horrible history in too little time. However, someone had to try so kudos to the director for that effort. That period of history was deeply cruel and it's hard to imagine how else to make the story palatable. Visually, the movie is terrific. The brutality in some scenes, although no doubt historically accurate, is tough to watch. I thought the local commissar was very effective in his cruelty, and in comparison, the Stalin figure almost seemed like a lightweight. A number of the professional critic reviews sound downright snarky. This isn't an easy move to watch or an easy story to tell. And while there is plenty of room for suggestions of how to improve, it is not a movie of no value as some wrote. The accusations of exaggeration and melodrama are actually bizarre. I think the famine and the horrors of communism, which my parents and grandparents lived through, were no doubt much worse than depicted here.",7
573,Think the Holocaust was the greatest mass murder in history?,"Well, not even close. Communism in the 20th century murdered 100,000,000 (Buy and read the ""Black Book of Communism"" - 800 plus pages - so not for Millenials) and this is a taste of that murder. This Holodomor _ Death by Hunger was purposeful, evil, malevolent and ultimately stupid. Oh, Muslims (Moghuls) murdered 60,000,000 Hindus - we await those movies.Americans know of the Holocaust and some other historical events but are utterly clueless about history. You can observe that by the nonsense children are brainwashed with in government schools here in the US.We need 100 more of these movies as the texting generation gets bored after a paragraph or two.Did you know that the Soviets only had one American industry or group that reportedly directly to Moscow. Take a guess - rhymes with Bollywood and that is why this genre of movies will not be made in California. Too bad they are such ""Useful Idiots"" as Stalin used to call them.Great movie. Well done and detested by the Left so you know it hit the bullseye.",10
574,I wanted to like it,"The acting is good, the chemistry between the leads is effective, the evocations of village life are beautiful, the panoramic views of Ukraine are splendid, the music is beautiful, the subject is important—and yet, Bitter Harvest does heart-breaking disservice to those who perished in the Holodomor. Trying to cover political history from the death of the Tsar announced in one scene (evidently in 1918) to the famine itself (1932-3), while the romantic drama seems to take only a couple of years, blurs and trivializes history. The Hollywood hijinks and impossible escapes caricature the real conditions from which there was no escape. A few peasants standing in the fog with make-up circles under their eyes belittles the piles of skeletal corpses and bloated bodies of children that even one photograph of the real Holodomor bears witness to. Showing a fleeting screen shot of an article from the New York Times about the famine without clarifying that it was written by the notorious Soviet falsifier Walter Duranty (whom Malcolm Muggeridge called ""the most dishonest journalist I have ever encountered in my fifty years of journalism"") – Duranty, a famine-denier who stands as one of the reasons that the Holodomor is not better known in the west – simply sickens. For all the money spent on special effects (well done, by the way), the scope of the Holodomor is utterly lost. And what would it have cost to hire a decent screenwriter who could have reined in a plot that tries to do too much, and who instead could have focused on some serious moral dilemma that those impossible conditions spawned on the level of the individual? Yes, see the movie – there is worse Hollywood silliness out there, and the good things listed at the top are worth seeing. But then, for history's sake, go out and BUY A COPY of Harvest of Sorrow, by Robert Conquest (who passed away recently, alas). It is the definitive history of the Holodomor, and – in this time of 'alternative facts'—the facts needs to be set straight. https://www.amazon.com/Harvest-Sorrow- Soviet-Collectivization-Terror-Famine/dp/0195051807",6
575,The true colour of communism!!!,"I have heard Holocaust, but not Holodomor. Thanks to this film. This is a piece of history. A bitter history, that people of the world should know what communism does. It commenced during the end of Tsar era and when Stalin's reign began. The film focused on a young man grew up in a small town, dreaming to be an artist. But suddenly everything has changed once Ukraine struggled to gain its independence from the Soviet Union. From his perspective, his journey through the Unkraine's toughest time had been explained. It had some romance, but overwhelmed by an unending conflict. They had to wait for 60 years, finally to get what they were fighting for.The music was good. The background score accompanied awesomely throughout the narration. Decent actors and direction. Overall a good film, but I don't know what went wrong for it fail to reach out the people. Maybe the unfamiliar cast. But anyway, this film still did better in Ukraine as expected. From the 30s, slowly faded away from the world's interest in this matter. Mainly the reason could have been the WWII. Otherwise, there's no difference between what had happened here comparing to what nazis did a decade later. Why not, you will surely learn something out of it. So definitely yes, I would recommend it.7/10",7
576,Bitter Harvest Worth seeing,"Bitter Harvest is the story of the Holodomor told through the eyes of one family of peasant farmers.I find that most ""critics"" are so full of themselves and talk about esoteric crap that 99% of most movie goers to could care less about that render such 'professional"" reviews all but worthless.The story is not about the Holodomor in its totality as the massive act of genocide of the Ukrainian people but rather, it is the love story about a young man in love with a girl from his village and the destruction of their lives as a result of the Holodomor.In this regard the movie does a fantastic job telling us the story of their lives and the horrific struggles that ensue to just survive. The only minor criticism I have is the romantic leads (Max Irons( Yuri ) and Samantha Barks (Natalka)) lack any real on screen chemistry which makes their romantic scenes seem mildly contrived. The movie does a good job of showing some of the horror perpetrated by Stalin's ruthless starvation of the Ukrainian people. It does not delve deeply into the Holodomor but rather tells the account though the eyes of Yuri and Natalka. I found the moving to be very moving.",8
577,Bitter Harvest the history unfolds,"Bitter Harvest the history unfolds Bitter Harvest narrates the saga of devastating famine of Josef Stalin 1930s era in Ukrain. Film becomes more interesting when it narrates the story of characters; director takes us close to their aspirations, dreams and reality.Ukrain is the border nation for German and Russians. What we read in press about red revolution of 1930s which is glorified by films such as October, Battleship of Potemkin. We forget how Stalin had already set for mass-murder by deliberate starvation of millions of Ukrainians.Today Ukrain being the eastern European country does not get space in news paper. If you are a world cinema student and enthusiast or may be a social, political or Mass Communication expert do watch the film and you will see how your perception about communism changes. We do not find any difference of fascism and communism. It is one of the most overlooked tragedies of the 20th Century, BITTER HARVES The film is based on real life history from Soviet-era man-made famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s. More than 3.5 million people died, some say 10 million.We follow tepid love story between Yuri and his childhood sweetheart, Natalka (Samantha Barks). Directed showcased the armed struggle by kulaks and their sympathizers.Bitter Harvest is a film which talks about the social and political turmoil and its roots deeply engulfed in corruption, politics and communism. 1930 is known for the year of economic depression and biggest man made famine. Ukraine is the newly joined part to USSR and how the biggest man made famine is created is depicted in the film. Indian audience can relate this film as the story progresses with the love story of the characters. The literature students will relish it with span of time shown from the birth of child to their love and mature years. Historical scholars and political pundits will like this film as it takes us close to the people of Ukraine.",9
578,This should be required viewing for every one in the USA.,"This is a heart wrenching movie, but one that tells a story that seems few are aware of. Those too common apologists for communism need to see this movie to get a dose of reality concerning the nature of that system under Stalin and what it did to the people of the Ukraine. This movie has excellent acting that removes all impediments to being fully absorbed in the cinematic allusion. There are endless movies about Hitler's Germany, but this single movie stands out as a message that the Ukrainians' experience rivals the worst of what various groups suffered under the Nazis. The history from which this story is extracted has been swept under the rug, as the telling of history is controlled by the victors. Imagine how the atrocities of Hitler's regime would have been painted away if Germany had won WW2. I take this movie as an attempt to rectify this and bring awareness to the current plight of the Ukrainian people as they continue to struggle against Russian dominion. I think my own awareness was greatly expanded because of the well executed visual imagery Bitter Harvest provided.Some seem to dislike the romantic fiction aspect of the picture. I see it as a mechanism to provide some shoes for the common man/woman to walk in so as to be able to feel how it might have been if this had been our own story.",10
579,Great Movie,"It is refreshing to see a historical movie about a genocidal event that gets overlooked because it occurred just six years before World War 2 and the Holocaust. Personally, the movie did a good job at introducing and exposing the audience to the Ukraine famine of 1933 and what these people had to endure at the time. The movie has its flaws obviously but does a good job introducing an event for the 1st time in the movies.",10
580,Must see!,"It must be very difficult for any film to convey historical facts within its allotted budget and run time. However, even considering a Hollywood spin on tragic history, if the movie makes you think, makes you want to know more about a tragedy previously unknown to you, then it has done its job. I am of an age that the Holodomor was not taught when I was in school. (Nor was the Irish famine/genocide, sadly). After recent surgeries, I had the gift of home care from an agency of mostly former Ukrainian citizens who have come to the US for new beginnings. Knowing them made me want to know their history. How does any population survive such horror - and want to make a new life? Somehow, they do. Just as Braveheart and Rob Roy led me to explore the history behind them, so had this been an introduction to learning about what happened but was not taught in school. Beautifully done.",10
581,Unfocused Drama,"A common myth involving famine is that that it's entirely down to there not being enough food to go around an increasing human population . In other words there's too many people to survive on an essential resource , or ""Malthusian catastrophe"" to give it its technical term. What is being said is that there's too many people but there's often the innuendo that there's ""too many (Insert black , brown or yellow here) people"" here. The reality is that there's more than enough food in the world and the problems of food supply lie elsewhere, Don't believe me ? Ask yourself this:if there's more than 7 billion people in the world , more than it has ever been why is it that in the last few years only the Horn of Africa and North Korea have suffered famines ? You see my point ? It's nothing to do with resources and has everything to do with war in North East Africa and state policy in North Korea BITTER HARVEST tells the story of one of the worst man made disasters in human history , that of the 1930s Soviet famine , most especially the Holodomor experience of the Ukrainians. Make no mistake because the famine was entirely man made where Josef Stalin rescinded Lenin's New Economic Policy ( Lenin and Trotsky's name change for capitalism )and executed or imprisoned everyone who knew anything about farming or engineering. A recipe for disaster in other words The film itself is far from a disaster but constantly fails to make up its mind as to what it's trying to be. From the opening scene where the lead male and female are introduced as children you think that the film might be going one way only for it to go in a direction that it doesn't need to. It's a little bit love story , a little bit historical epic , a little bit action adventure etc but these segments never join up to a bigger picture , so much so it leads to an ultimately unsatisfying movie. It doesn't help that the goodies and baddies are painted in such broad stereotypical strokes This is especially annoying where the casting is involved. Tamar Hassan is an actor I know from low budget British hooligan sub-genre films but is something of a revelation as Commissar Sergei but ends up being a rudimentary villain because that's what the screenplay demands and it is the fault of the screenplay . On the other end of the spectrum is up and coming Welsh actor Aneurin Bernard who plays Mykola a multi-layered Marxist and complex character but quickly disappears from the narrative. Things like this draw your attention to the fact that this is a well meaning film but should have been a great film as well as a well meaning one",6
582,Dark Page in the Human Experience,"The Holodomor, or Ukrainian Holocaust is a dark topic. It is a short testimony to the power of the human spirit to survive even the most cruel and vile regimes in History. Even with the murder of 10 million Ukrainians by starvation in only 2 years, millions more survived. The bonds of love, family and heritage were what saved this great people from annihilation. Like the Holocaust in Germany only a decade later, we must learn and NEVER FORGET!!!",10
583,About Time,"There ought to be more movies/documentaries about this horrific event in Ukrainian history. The spirit of the people was not destroyed and the traditions, language, heritage, spirit of Ukrainians is alive today. Wish this movie was given a wider audience as the facts are a reminder how much a nation has suffered and lost and continues to fight back against Russia. The director did a wonderful job. A must see.",10
584,A must see!,"After raving about another movie I just saw, ""The Promise"" to a friend, she mentioned this movie so I made a point to watch it! Amazing movie and quite educational. How come I never heard of this movie? Hollywood puts out so much crap that I don't bother acknowledging anything they put out or critique. It's mostly garbage but once in a while you get some real gems and this is one of them. If you're a parent I highly recommend this movie as it's highly educational. I never knew there was a fammine in the Ukraine started by Stalin. Who knew? Go watch it!",10
585,"Good film, great effort.","Feel the same way about this movie as I felt about Nate Parker's Birth of a Nation which came out last year.Bitter Harvest is technically about a fairly new topic of the Holodomor. Though it happen 80 years ago I don't think enough information came out about it to make a movie until 2003 when the Russian admitted to it (At least that's what the film is telling me). As far as I know this is possibly the first movie all about the event with a focus on the story of Yuri, an artist at heart, warrior by birthright as he live through this genocide.The movie jitters a little. It reminds me of the awful Red Tails , which focus a lot on giving us info about the situation rather than telling a story. Weather the filmmakers admit to it or not they were giving us a lot of info more than telling us a story. Though at least that's how the film starts. As we get to know Yuri, the actor that played the part was really good and someone you wanted to pay attention as you go over Yuri's struggle.But the film technique is too robotic and formulated for me to get a full on emotional connection from all the main characters despite being played by great actors like Terrence Stamp who plays an old warrior and Yuri's grandfather.I was also very impressed by the actions sequences in the film. Like I said, the film is not organic enough to get much feeling for what I'm seeing but I respect the technique of the action being performed.The detailed story is nothing I have not seen before. No surprise, everyone at one point in history seems to have gone trough the same events portrayed in the movie (This is happening to people right now) So even though, I learned about Holodomor, A topic I never herd of before watching this film, The movie has nothing new to show me.So, I don't know if this is the first or one of the first times that a movie deals with this part of Ukrainian history before, but like Birth of a Nation, I want to give it credit for tackling the issue and being decent with the content and hope that the next movie I see on the subject does better.",7
586,sad movie about Russia's attempt to wipe out Ukrainians,"Although it is not right to write here about politics but one can not do without it while trying to explain this movie. It is world known that in 1930s russians, governed by communists, attempted once again to destroy Ukraine and its people by creating artificial Famine. The purpose was very simple - to destroy peasants - the core population of Ukraine - the carries of national traditions, history and memory. Next step - to send to vacationed Ukrainian territories ethnic russians - basically this is the explanation of ""russian-speaking"" Ukraine & nowadays terrorists in the Eastern Ukraine.Unfortunately, results were dreadful: up to 15M (according to American researchers) has died from famine. People were eating their children, each other. Probably movie is not artistic masterpiece but it deeply and in details describes the total dismay and despair of people who were sent to death just because they were Ukrainians and wanted to live on their land, cultivate their land and raise their children in Ukrainian customs and traditions....",10
587,Anger!,"I watched this film alone and tears came dripping down almost throughout the film. For the first time in my life, I wish that the German were victorious and that the Russians would experience what it meant to be under brutal oppression.Going back to the film, true, it is far from being a classic but perhaps this is exactly why it is so convincing: simplicity with no elaborate story-telling. Samantha Barks is wonderful, as expected. The shooting too, is moving, breath-taking even.It is a film that I will not forget for the rest of my life, nor the message behind it: unless we allow them to, no body can take away our freedom.And we are not going to allow them.",8
588,Holodomor means murder through starvation,"The Holodomor killed more people than the Nazi Holocaust or the Young Turks murder of millions of their Christian citizens through the Armenian Genocide. Bitter Harvest explores the history of this tragic event through the eyes of different villagers. A challenging movie with many well done vignettes, it anticipates the creation of more films about this event.An important difference between the Holodomor versus the Young Turks murder of millions of Armenians citizens is that the Russians have the courage to admit the painful past, thus opening the door to healing. Perhaps this is one of the universal strengths of the Slavic Soul, to be able to look in the mirror of history and through the pain of introspection create great art.Sadly, thus far, other than a handful of intellectuals, Turkish government remains trapped within the hell of self-deception denying the crimes committed by its forefathers. This ongoing dance of denial which some call ""Erdonial"" prevents progress and perhaps is one of the constraints against the creation of great art. Bitter Harvest is a good film with a strong cast turning in strong performances. It will make a good supplement for history classes, and for those times when one is in the mood for lesser known truths that need to be remembered.",7
589,Without a doubt one of the most thoughtless movies ever!,"As a Ukrainian who went and saw this with their grandparent who as a child suffered through the Holodomor, this movie was so personally offensive. When I heard a movie was being made about this genocidal event, I was cautious, the outcome could either be excellent or terrible. And at my grandmother's insistence, we saw it. The end of the movie I asked her what she thought; she cried. She cried, saying her country, the culture, the language, was butchered in ways she wished she hadn't seen. And I couldn't agree more, from frankly laughable dialogue to comical pronunciation of Ukrainian words by British actors, all in all I completely agree that on such an intense and deeply serious issue, this film should NOT have been created.",1
590,A good tale is out there but not here,"Disconnected and clinical look at what should have been a fascinating true story. Plastic acting, oversimplified script, terrible direction and editing which made one much better off googling the real ""Black Prince"". Almost unworthy even for TV. Very disappointing especially as there were so many high reviews on IMDb.",3
591,"Great period and figures in history poorly portrayed, missed opportunity","I was quite excited to see this film. India is a great nation with a rich and vast history. The premise and title showed it could be a great historical film. Sadly I was left rather disappointed. A number of things could have been tweaked or changed which makes this a missed opportunity. For most of this film it was somewhat hard to follow what was going on in some parts. We can understand the premise but the background that led to his exile and how he lost everything was loosely depicted. One could not follow exactly what was happening and I had to look up Wikipedia for information. Certain historical figures could have been used more such as Queen Victoria. This film never felt too coherent and quite disjointed, it recklessly jumped from scene to scene. With such great subject matter its a shame such a good story was badly told. Another thing I feel to mention is the lack of compassion I feel for the main character and historical figure. It is undeniable that India was under brutal and horrid British rule but did this Prince really get the short end of the straw? He was treated as royalty in England, captured the Queen's attention and lived in luxury for his young adult life. He also could have any woman he chooses. Life is not always fair but you make do with the hand you are dealt and the hand Duleep Singh was dealt was not so bad and he could make the best of his situation rather than completely turn his back on those who cared for him. Based purely on the film and information available online perhaps Duleep experienced so much loss in his adult life because he did not appreciate what he already had. Important to note that as an Indian he was treated with great respect and affection on British soil unlike Indians on Indian soil, it was his choice to denounce his new family. As Queen Victoria said there is no government built on truth. Nevertheless it could have been a great film but sadly lacked coherence and acute direction. 6/10",6
592,Must Watch!!,"This epic movie on the the Last King of Punjab is a MUST WATCH!! Having worked on the production as well as the passion for the history behind the movie plays close to heart. The cast was amazing as was the production. It gives the message as true as possible to the facts based on the research completed to make this feature. The main thing for me as a Biritish SIkh born and raised in England was how it shows Maharaj Duleep Singh was kept as a Christian and how he finds his faith and gets baptised as a Sikh, his true heritage.",10
593,Slow-paced yet worth watching,It is a story about the last sovereign king of Punjab. Definetly not a mainstream stereotypical movie.. some good acting esp by Shabana Aazmi ..an interesting yet somewhat unknown historical narrative of Duleep Singh..slow yet worth seeing..,6
594,"Great Movie, after a long time","10/10 story nice depicted, A must watchThe last Sikh prince of Punjab is placed on the throne at five, but when India is annexed to the British, he is sent to England and never allowed to return to his home.THE TRUE STORY OF MAHARAJAH DULEEP SINGH.",10
595,"Disappointing production, disjointed story line, lacklustre performances","I was greatly looking forward to seeing this film about one of the most important periods in Sikh history. However I left the cinema feeling very disappointed. The producer and director missed a unique opportunity to portray events properly. For starters, Duleep Singh was portrayed as a morose, colourless, depressed person. There was no spark at all. Queen Victoria did not look remotely like the actual person. The other actors were no better than any school amateur drama group. Many of the events in the film were not shown to their natural conclusions. For example, what happened to the Sikhs being herded in the jail? It's no point writing out in the end that so many were hanged etc. No, I am not looking for gory scenes, but, there are dignified and thoughtful ways of showing such events. I came to see a film not read a book! His exile in Scotland where he got the nickname of the Black Prince, was not shown. Scenes have been put together like a drunk attempting a jigsaw puzzle. The only character who gave a good and realistic performance was Shabana Azmi as the Prince's mother. But it still was not enough to save the film. Don't waste your time and money on this film. See something else.",2
596,A Tale of Last King of Punjab,"About 70-75% of Sikhs/Punjabis are really unaware of this part of our history. The movie is based on true story and facts about 'Maharaja Duleep Singh', who was exiled to Britain. His relation with Queen Victoria and his mom 'Jind Kaur' and his fight to get his kingdom back from Britishers is beautifully explained. It is not only about Sikhs or Punjabis, It is for all who tried hard or fought for their pride and rights.",10
597,Amazing MUST WATCH Movie,"First of all, the acting of Satinder Sartaj was sensational as his emotions really matched the tone and mood of the movie. The movie was very well put together and didn't hide any elements of history which in turn added to the realism of the movie. Overall, I'd conclude saying if you're a fellow Punjabi and want to know historically about the region then this movie is for you. Lastly, i don't give many 10/10's but this movie truly deserved it!",10
598,"Don't believe the critics, Best movie on sikh history","Well i catched the screening in Hong Kong yesterday. I was very impressed by the acting, music and flow of the movie. It's a very well given tribute to Maharaja Duleep Singh, the last maharaja of sikhs. Satinder Sartaj played his role very honestly and very good for first timer. His eyes speak more than his dialogues. I would like to thank the team of the black prince who made and brought this beautiful piece of work to the audience. its a must watch for every person especially sikhs to get to know about their rich history. And very well taught lesson on sikh history especially on maharaja duleep singh's life journey. Don't forget to listen to the songs. They lift the quotient of the emotions in the film and they are just beautiful. i watched the Hindi version and it was really good. Will be watching the English version once its out on DVD.",9
599,Well worth watching!,"Best understood if you already know something about British History in the Punjab or are of Punjabi origin. That should not detract other interested viewers. The Raj is not portrayed in a great light and this has triggered some knee-jerk reaction in the content of some professional reviews and press elsewhere. However rather than use this to create divide or animosity over historic events, it is testament to the good morals and integrity of the majority of Sikhs who have embraced the UK as their home and positively contributed so much to modern day Britain as well as the sacrifices made during two world wars. They have managed to overlook the earlier battles against the British before Punjab was annexed and this defining period in history where Sikh rule and the Kingdom of Punjab was effectively and abruptly brought to an end. The story of Maharaja Duleep Singh (The Black Prince) whilst tragic for a lost individual and wandering soul could be marginalized by observing his obvious flaws and flamboyant lifestyle. However, realizing that his life was largely out of his control from the tender age of 5 years, his shortcomings should be forgiven to realize the true tragedy lies in the loss of direction for his people and the demise of the grand Kingdom his father (Maharaja Ranjit Singh) justly ruled.",9
600,Heart Rendering Historical Drama,"The entire movie is based on one royal family member and his plight from subtle trans cultural ambiguity and emotional turmoil. The hero's acting was outstanding. Even though I have vast experience in life, I was able to learn more about patience, respect, devotion and passion from merely watching the way the hero performed. Outstanding actor and a romantic actor of a kind. The supporting stars such as Queen Elizabeth, his British Father, His real estranged Mother, His personal Aide, The Palace staff and their adoration, the Punjabi Priests and the Revolutionist were meant to edify and reinforce the hero's pleasant and royal persona even in the midst of difficult times. I was amazed by the utmost loyalty of the personal Aide to the hero. The movie ends in sad note which came as a dislike to the audience, who at the end of the show were still mourning. I thought it was very true and real and not confabulated with fiction. I gave an 8",8
601,Worth Watch,The Black Prince brings forth the forgotten chapters of the history. Set in the 19th Century it reminds the Sikh audience about their lost glory and brings in an emotive touch and deep sense of loss. Its tragic story but it makes you positively restless.I strongly recommend youngsters to watch it.,10
602,'The Black Prince',"A must watch movie. Best ever in Punjabi cinema...Everyone should watch this movie, as it is the great saga of last king of Punjab 'Maharaja Duleep Singh'. Most people are saying that this movie lacks something, but according to me, this was a great approach to tell the real life history of the maharaja. Satinder sartaj and Shabana Azmi ji both played their roles very well, like a professional. Congratulations to the whole team for bringing such a great saga of maharaja duleep singh to the people.",9
603,movie,totally awesome movie its great honour for me and my respected dr.satinder sartaj as a lead role in this movie.finally this is a first movie who create in punjabi language and most of all the character work in more than good.the hstory of this movie is related to punjabi culture so i really appreciate for this movie.,10
604,Great Movie,"The movie depicts the story of Maharaja Duleep Singh in a very powerful way. Watching the movie was like living the History. The act of Shabana Azmi as Maharani Jindan, mother of Maharaja Duleep Singh, was great. The film makers were successful in presenting the historical facts on silver screen in an artistic way.",10
605,The Black Prince,"An incredibly beautiful looking movie. The story is so rich and the actors bring the people on the page to life. Grwat overall movie, highly recomended.",8

607,Must watch for Sikhs,All those people who are giving bad reviews to movie are mainly non-punjabis having no knowledge about Maharaja Ranjit Singh and his kingdom.Those who are aware of legacy of Maharaja will surely connect with the film.,10
608,"Great period drama, great acting, great set, great cinematography and great script",The tale of Maharaja Duleep Singh in 2 hours could not be told better in 2 hours. The film has done a great job capturing the key moments of his life. I guess it would be fair to say that anybody not aware of who he was and why he was such a crucial figure in Anglo Indian history may not capture the true essence of the film. I have sent all my friends to watch this film given this pointers as a background (All these points have supporting evidence):1. Maharaja Duleep was the son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Who ruled the Punjab prior to colonial rule and it was his kingdom that was split to create Pakistan before colonial rule left India 1947 2. Panjab(Duleeps kingdom) was about 4 to 5 times bigger than current day Panjab and was wealthier than England. To give you an idea the Kohinoor is valued at £100m today and that was just one of his thousands of assets. Also his kingdom helped to finance GB industrial revolution 3. Duleep was a threat as he was symbol of hope to his people the fact that he was separated from his mother and never allowed to set foot on his birth soil not even in death support this notion. No other Indian king was taken in this manner. Why would he not be allowed to go back home or be with his mom? Sophie Steven played Bamba Muller so well she moved me to tears.Shabana Azmi - my god subtle yet powerful.Amanda Root - amazingJason Flemming - Smooth.Satinder Sartaaj - portrayed the calm before the storm very.David Essex - Great Leanne Joyce - Sassy I think the film created the atmosphere it aimed to created and you can feel it throughout the film It kept me watching from beginning to end and also moved me to tears. Make sure you have tissues with you :-),10
609,Represented the part of story that very few people knew in today's era.,A must watch movie which depicts about how the sikh reign ended and how sikhs got cheated by the britishers.,10
610,Exceeded expectations!,I watched this movie with expectations of an important part of Sikh History delivered with a heavy wash of Indian patriotism. I was suprised that the director showed the Sikh narrative of the tragic events and was honest and sincere in delivering his message. Sartaj took on this project with zero experience in acting and to be honest during the movie I forgot that Sartaj was whom I was watching. Such was the brilliance and dedication from Sartaj in portraying Duleep Singh.,10
611,Just give it a try...,"I've seen this movie and must comment that it's a real easy-to-watch movie. The beautiful language (Italian) is showed at it's best, in fast and loud conversations full of emotion. But I guess you have to be non-Italian to notice it :D. The title explains how the characters live their lifes, now or never. I have no material to compare this Italian movie to except for La Vita è bella but that's to much of a different story. Oh well, it's about students during the G8 in Genua and how a guy turns from a typical straight A student to a protesting, world loving rebel. Offcourse there is a girl, a bad guy, or a whole bunch of 'em and a best friend. The play is mostly in Pisa, so enjoy the sight :D",7
612,Very interesting Movie,"I've saw this Movie at the Locarno Filmfestival. It's a film about friendship and growing old. The Screenplay is pretty good, and the story is interesting. If you get the chance you should go and watch it.",7
613,Just because it's for kids doesn't mean it has to be brainless and cheap,"I was about as excited about watching The Squeakquel as Marie Antoinette was about walking to the guillotine. From the trailer alone, you can tell this was made with the hope of making a quick buck with as little quality as possible. It succeeded, as it made millions of quick bucks at the box office and it just made another when my mother decided to buy the DVD. We decided to spend quality time together watching this thing, and after wasting precious minutes of my life with bad jokes and a stale plot, I have decided to review it.The chipmunk trio is sent to high school, where they deal with stereotypical high school problems and have a rivalry with a female group of chipmunks, The Chipettes. The Chipette's manager is the greedy manager of the Chipmunks from the last movie, seeking to reclaim his former glory by making millions off of the female group's talent. Then, there's a plot where the Chipmunks sign up for a talent show in order to win money for the school's music program, which is losing funding, a plot I'm sure has never before been used.The story is about as interesting as the synopsis. You could make a drinking game based off of how often you can predict what's going to happen next. None of the characters besides the main trio are interesting, the jokes fall flat, and all the high school ""trauma"" the chipmunks deal with is about as real as an episode of Saved By the Bell.Now, I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or some grade A masterpiece with complex themes and characters. I knew perfectly well this is a kids film and not one of excellent quality at that. It fails nonetheless. Just because a movie is for kids doesn't mean you have to reach for the lowest common denominator in order to entertain them, it doesn't mean you have to give them a thin plot with the freshness of a rotten apple core, it doesn't mean you have to reach for teenage stereotypes that should have been out with big hair, and it doesn't mean you shouldn't at least TRY to put a decent amount of effort into the final product! 3/10.",2
614,good family fun!,"After all the negative reviews I read, I went in with pretty low expectations. Perhaps that's why I ended up giving up a 7.Look, this is not Hamlet, Citizen Kane or Duck Soup. This is a PG film that as close to being family friendly than I have seen. I can only imagine the PG rating was due to the fact that the chipettes were darn right sexy - I didn't hear any vulgarity, see any nudity, violence or adult situations.It is really getting hard to find a film where I can take my 9 year old daughter to. With battling giant robots, vampires, and giant smurfs lurking in 3D, this movie was a relief to see.The plot is paper thin - though in its defense it did have an ethical base of family, friendship, and responsibility.The effects were top notch, and there were a few times I even laughed (which was a few more times than I expected).In one word it was - 'Cute' - which is exactly what I think it sought out to be. Nothing more.. Nothing less. Harmless fluff.My 9 year old enjoyed it. And at the end of the day, that's all that mattered to me.This is a film for children. Taken on it's level, I give it a 7. if you want to rate it as art or entertainment for adults? Yeah, mebbe a 2 or 3. But you know what? Some kids were clapping at parts in the theater. To me, that was pretty cool knowing that a film can get kids in a theater clapping for the characters on the screen.So relax. chill.. bring your little ones... and enjoy...",7
615,"Should be renamed, Alvin & yip schmucks! This movie was awful.","In 1958, struggling songwriter Ross Bagdasarian found himself a hit by increasing the speed of the recording, making his voice sound funny. With this, he create three cartoon characters to fit the high pitch: Alvin, Simon and Theodore, The Chipmunks. They were a big hit in the '50s, and once again, a big hit in the 1980s with a TV cartoon series. In 2007, the series once again got remade. This time live-action with some CGI effects. Although the first movie did re-spark an interest in the Chipmunks franchise, many fans weren't exactly impressed with the movie and its 2009 & 2011 sequels. As much as I hate the 2007 remake of 'Alvin and Chipmunks', this Squeakquel was downright insufferable. In the movie, Alvin (Voiced by Justin Long) is downright more sociopathic in his behavior, while Simon (Voiced by Matthew Gray Gubler) is a dumb down and Theodore (Voiced by Jesse McCartney) is just a stupid punchline to be abused and made fun of. The first movie has a story/moral in which the three chipmunks realize that fame and fortune is not all it is cracked out to be, and leave the seemingly superficial lifestyle, and the money, behind to enjoy an apparently better down-to-earth life. Yet, it's forgotten here, because the movie starts off, how very self-centered, they became. The whole plot feels rushed because there are so many plot elements to throw into the mix here that it never falls into a cohesive storyline. It's a plot that make little to no sense, as the Chipmunks are forced to go to school. I understand, the writers were trying to adapt the old cartoon, but the thing you have to remember is that in the cartoon, the anthropomorphic chipmunks there, were as tall as most human children their age and look more human that its couther parts here. That allowed the show to get away with having singing anthropomorphic chipmunks live like normal children. Here they are regular sized chipmunks so that same idea simply doesn't work. If they were to go to school, wouldn't it be for anthropomorphic animals. Another thing, if they were allow to join a human school; I really doubt their age in chipmunks years match that of a human high school student. Wouldn't they be in middle school? Another thing about the weak plot, is the premise of saving the school music program. The whole music program is barely establish and we never get the why it will be shut down, unless the school wins a music competition. We, the audience, never know why it's important to the school. It's not like the Chipmunks are helping or training any of the students in the music program to win the competition. When you think about it, there isn't any music students established at all. Who knows, if there were a music program in the first place, before the Chipmunks arrived. Added to this stupid premise is the presence of the previous film villain, Ian Hawke (David Cross) whom plans to use a female version of the Chipmucks to steal the Chipmunks' fame by entering the singing group into the same school music competition. The Chipettes made out of Eleanor (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Jeanette (Voiced by Anna Faris), and Brittany (Voiced by Christina Applegate) really come out of nowhere in the film, and serve nothing, but love interested. They are so hit by the pitch shifting you can't even tell them apart. I don't even, know why they couldn't use voice actors for them. In the cartoon series, they are supposed to rivals to the Chipmunks, but you never see them go one on one, here. The Chippettes in real life were created for the sole purpose of allowing Ross Bagdasarian to make covers of popular girls' songs in addition to the guys' songs covered by the Chipmunks. So the Chippettes are, in essence, the Chipmunks with girl parts. Very hollow characters. There barely any good female leads here. Despite being Dave's love interest, and a key character in the first film, Claire is nowhere to be found here. This is mainly because Cameron Richardson refused to reprise the role, as she strongly disliked being in the first film. The supporting characters that did show up in the film are just awful. Jason Lee is barely in the film as Dave Seville. Zachary Levi as Toby was awful as a Dave's replacement. His sub-plot romantic with the teacher was just not needed, and doesn't help move the plot. Everything about his performance was underwhelming. You really don't get to see the great conflict that Alvin has with Dave in Toby. It was one of the things that made the series stand out! The jokes are mostly misses than hits. The obligatory fart joke, the embarrassingly inaccurate racial stereotypes, and slapstick humor were all badly delivered. Even the cultural pop references don't even make much sense, because the film references a lots of nearly unknown shows that children probably don't watch, like Meerkat Manor or NASCAR on FOX, with the cameo Digger the NASCAR gopher. The film is disturbing, as it already portray pedophilia and bestiality like themes with human beings lusting for naked under aged chipmunks. Add, references to 1991's Silent of the Lambs and 1976's Taxi Driver, and you got a movie that makes you wonder if this movie is truly a kid movie. Depending who you are, the pop songs used in the film could seem brutally murder or watered down. It didn't bug me, too much. The 3D gimmick kinda did its job, but the whole CG & the unrealistic speed it's moving at, makes it hard to watch in 3D at times. Overall: It's nearly unwatchable, even for kids. Instead of watching this movie, go back and re-watched the 1980s cartoons. You'll get more fun out of that, than this.",3
616,Even the Kiddies Weren't Buying It,"Today I had to sit through this movie several times. :-(As an adult, it wasn't funny or entertaining. But what amused me was the reaction from the kids in the audiences. Almost none of the kids laughed out loud during the matinée viewing (the showing with the most kids in attendance). Some take away comments from the mouth of babes: ""Is it over YET?"" ""I'm bored"" and my personal favorite ""That wasn't so funny at all."" (poor kid said it over and over again with the ""big"" jokes.) Plus, I had never seen so many kids ready to leave after the first 15 minutes. It didn't get better over the course of the evening.",1
617,"Perfect for young families and animation fans, but not for everyone else.","Saw an early screening. I never saw the first one, but within the context of it being a kids' movie, it was actually quite well made. I actually laughed at the jokes, and I'm 33 and educated. If I were a young kid, I'd love this movie a lot, but I'm way past that and am often quite critical of children's genre films these days. The plot was coherent and the moral issues were clear. The characters stay true to themselves, much to anyone who is a fan of the original cartoon characters, and the dynamic of character triads works well for moral storytelling.The moral lesson to be taught is about learning to be selfless and considerate of others. This is explored through Alvin and his ego problem, and the consequences it has on his friends and family. Other characters have their own arcs as well, and they read clear and convincingly.On the downside, I think there are some choices that hurt the quality. Dave, the most famous human character in the franchise is probably in the film for about 5 minutes total, however the human characters we're left with are good performers with decent subplots. I did not care for the cliché use of a fart joke, but I forgive it because there was only one, and it was used in a way that's actually still funny to adults.Sure, it's not the most intellectual film for an adult audience, but it serves its purpose and achieves its goals, despite being the result of commercialism. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to take their small kids out to a movie.",6
618,"Bad jokes, irritating characters.","This movie just fails on so many levels. It is terrible, I couldn't even sit through it. Don't watch it, ever, don't even show it to your kids, because they might like it at the time, but they'll get brain damage or something. So just don't check it out, definitely not, if you have to pay for it.Okay, let's start with the title. Squeakquel? Really? What the hell is that? Squeaking sequel? Did the producers think this was a funny and clever title? Let me tell you something: IT'S NOT! Moving on. The jokes. They're not funny. A poor old lady in a wheelchair falling down the stairs? Come on! Who wrote this crap? Stephen Hawking? (You see, that's an example of a bad, tasteless, offensive joke. The movie is full of them.)One big problem in the film is, that the supporting characters tend to forget that the Chipmunks are, well damn chipmunks and not kids! Squirrels (even if they talk) are allowed to go to school? They need someone to babysit them? They're rock stars for god's sake? Gosh Another thing that caught my attention: when those kids put the squirrels into the toilet, isn't that animal cruelty? Shouldn't they go to prison for that or something?All in all, this film is really stupid, badly written and annoying. The studio must be thinking that kids are stupid and all kinds of crap is good for them. Sorry if I cursed a lot, but this movie offended me by how bad it was. It's not the case where something is so bad it's good, it's just very bad.I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. Maybe those who're blind and their hearing is impaired (ba-damm-tss).",1
619,A Nutshell Review: Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squekquel,"I will not deny that I've grown up with the Alvin and the Chipmunks cartoon series on television, and had unabashedly enjoyed their very first cinematic outing way back in the year 2007, formulaic the storyline may be like an extended cartoon episode. That it had raked in enough cash meant a sequel wouldn't be far away, and the logical progression in terms of the introduction of new characters, translated to the ushering of The Chipettes, voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler and Anna Faris as Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette respectively.But the sequel suffered from having a rather half baked plot in trying to pit one set of chipmunks over the other, and complicated itself by trying to do too much in too little, having to write off their human guardian Dave (Jason Lee) to replace him with nephew Toby (Zachary Levi) who's about as plain as a piece of cardboard, and the very tired Alvin versus his brothers in an all for one and one for none subplot involving his association with the football jocks in search for a higher popularity.Even the villain too was a repeat in having Ian (David Cross) make a comeback, in trying to exploit the Chipettes for his comeback after falling from grace in the first film, without the clunky corporate executive being corrupted by greed and money stemming from good intentions. Here he's manipulative in a child-like fashion through and through, and you can see his grand plot from a mile away when he tries to isolate one of the Chipettes whom he thinks will be a better solo artist at the expense of the rest. So it's a revisit of the same old themes of family togetherness over friends, or over careers, which got repeated twice for the different triplets. And it's either me, or somehow having the chipmunks all sounding alike (despite having a different voice cast) got to me this time round. The redeeming grace of having them sing and dance to contemporary pop tunes also took a nose dive here, having the number of performances got reduced, and of course the novelty of having such songs ""munked"" have lost their lustre.However, having it released during this festive period would mean that all will get forgiven, and children will once again be thrilled by the all singing, all dancing chipmunks welcoming the festive cheer. There's a coda at the end of the film as well, so don't just head out the cinema once the credits start to roll.",2
620,The Kids Loved It,"I asked my 11 year old and 7 year old daughters what they thought of this film. They both loved it. The 3 on IMDb is a bit misleading. This is a film for children, not a campaign to win an Academy Award! Obviously there are people out there who take things a little toooooo seriously when rating kid's movies.My 11 year old daughter writes the following: the movie was great. i love the sounds of those little voices. why are kids films usually getting a 2,3,4? the film the music, adventure,scenes were all entertaining for me. Remember folks, this is a film for children, the chipmunks have been around for more than 30 years so they must be doing something right. If you want to over analyze a film then do a search on the French new age section and go your hardest, on the other hand if you are looking for pure entertainment for your under 12's then go no further.",7
621,"Decent. movie, could have been better...","I can honestly say the movie itself was only decent, I did expect better and this is coming from a huge fan of the chipmunks, dating back to the early 80's when the cartoon series reined. I enjoyed the first 3D chipmunk movie, I watched it a few times and there wasn't too much with it that I did not like. But this movie... it had me smile a few times, other times it kinda let me down because it did not live up to my expectations.One of the BIGGEST disappointments to me was the limited interaction the chipmunks and chipettes had with each other throughout the movie. It certainly wasn't like the old cartoons where they were all together getting into mischief, competing with each other, or just plain having fun doing whatever it was they did. It was always enjoyable watching Alvin and Britney going at it, while the other 4 tried to keep them out of trouble. In this movie their interaction with each other is very limited, and when they do interact, it's mostly in depressing or angry situations. In the old cartoons, sure they squabbled, especially Alvin and Britney... but it was in a fashion that left you smile cause you know deep down they all cared. In this movie they seemed.. cold to each other, especially Alvin vs. Simon.Examples are when Alvin tries to warn Britney about Ian Hawk, Britney turns a cold shoulder to Alvin's advice and ends up on the floor covered in food, angry at Alvin. Another example is a scene showing a depressed Theodore because of his brothers fought for a good portion of the movie, Eleanore comes over to talk to him. Just when you think she's gonna cheer him up, the scene ends abruptly in my opinion. Last example is when Alvin misses the music competition and shows up late, Britney just looks at him all sad and says ""BTW, I didn't want to win this way"" then walks away.. what the heck is that? There's also the constant arguing and fighting going on with Alvin and Simon, and Theodore spends a good amount of his time being sad. I was not expecting some chipmunk love story where they all fall for each other and live happily ever after, but I did expect to see them all get along for more of the movie. The majority of the movie was about them fighting and distrusting each other, it's not the image I remember from my youth.I understand that the storyline was that Ian wanted revenge on the chipmunks, and didn't want the chipettes to trust the chipmunks so they couldn't warn them about who he really was. Simon and Alvin we're fighting because Alvin was being his egotistical self, and Theodore didn't like it. The storyline in theory was good; it's the way it was executed that kinda killed it. It felt like they tried to do too much, and accomplished so little. It's like the movie was just a bunch of short random scenes that eventually came together in some fashion, but never felt entirely complete. Again, I think I feel this way because you never really see ALL of the chipmunks together in this one, and it seems to focus on Alvin and Simon a lot more than the other four. Because this Squeakuel introduces the chipettes, by the end of the movie you feel like the chipmunks and chipettes never really got to know each other, then they all end up living together in the end?Besides the limited interaction with the chipmunks and chipettes as a whole, where was Dave? In a hospital bed almost the entire movie. Don't get me wrong I'm not a huge fan of Jason Lee, but jeez why cut Dave out of almost the entire movie? He's part of the Chipmunks franchise, and he made very limited appearances. Instead they put in some nerd cousin of David's who wants to take no responsibility and play video games. Who is this guy? I don't ever remember seeing him before, why take out Dave? I did start to kind of like him by the end, but still.. he was no replacement for Dave.So there's that, those are my biggest disappointments about the movie. Besides the flawed execution of the story, the limited interaction of the munks, and the lack of Dave.. it was enjoyable to watch. I can honestly say unless you are a chipmunk fan from the past, you probably will not like this movie. I am personally hoping for a 3rd movie just to correct the mistakes of this one, and carry on this wonderful legacy. I want to see all 6 munks running around, laughing and playing, and getting into trouble like the good old days.",7
622,More of the same ... and the others,"You know this still works for the little ones, but will appall a lot older viewers, than say the first one did. It's basically more of the same, even with the addition of some Chipmunks ""rivals"" (another group of talking ...). The little ones won't mind (I watched it with my nephew and he enjoyed it), but what about the parents? There are other movies that can please both.Still not really that bad, you can watch this in its own right or at least put the kids there and let them enjoy it. It's like the Chipmunks won't grow up (literally and physically that is), but again it's only us grown-ups that will think about things like that.",4
623,"Seek out the Squeakquel, do, all who desire a fun family flick","The darling chipmunks are back and continue their careers as rock singers! While performing on stage, however, Alvin accidentally causes his ""dad"", David Seville (Jason Lee) to have a major accident. Soon Dave is in traction at the local hospital and has called his aunt to care for A, Simon, and Theodore. But, she, too, has a pratfall at the airport and so her grandson, Toby (Zachary Levi), ends up watching the singing rodents. Toby, however, is very young and although he tries hard, keeping up with the chipmunks is difficult. For starters, the chipmunks now attend the local high school, where the girls are gaga for them and the boys are miffed that they aren't getting as much attention. Most importantly, the school's music department needs money so the principal (Wendie Malick) has signed the performing chipmunks up for a ""battle of the high school bands"". Meanwhile, former manager Ian (David Cross) is near-homeless and living next to the music studio where he was once employed. One day, three little GAL chipmunks (voiced by Christina Applegate, Amy Poehler, and Anna Faris) arrive especially to see him, for they can sing and they are hoping to be his new act. Ho, ho, perhaps this is the way for Ian to get back to the top of the biz. Learning about the band battle, he enrolls the female chipmunks at the same high school and insists on that they join the musical competition. What will be the result? This is another winner in the family flick category. The chipmunks are darling and, what a nice turn, we now have the Chipettes, too, those lovable female chipmunks. All of the actors voicing the cute critters do a very nice job. Lee, unfortunately, has very little screen time but Cross, Malick, and all of the others do a fine job. The story, musical numbers, and direction are all great while the wonderful animation is a huge asset, for the chipmunks really are something special to behold. One minor criticism, however, is that the high school students practice ""swirlies"", that is, dunking kids and chipmunks, headfirst, into the toilet. This cruel practice could have been left out. But, all in all, do seek out the Squeakquel, it is fun, fun, and more fun.",8
624,"Good, so long as you don't expect a serious film","I really enjoyed this film, but mostly because I went in with the expectation that I would have an hour and a half of laughs and general fun, not a serious film. I have seen the first film, and this isn't as good as it, but probably because film makers always use up all there best ideas in the first films, very few sequels live up to or surpass the originals. Obviously it's not the sort of film you can watch again and again, the jokes are clichéd and will quickly become old to anyone over the age of about 8. It never ceases to amaze me why adults go and see a children's film and somehow expect a serious film. All in all, good fun, the quality of the film isn't bad. Children will enjoy this, and their parents won't be bored by it either!",6
625,What did you expect?,"Given the really low rating on this website, I just have to use the word ""Honestly"" when I say that I honestly enjoyed this movie.I even liked it more than the first.I really don't know what you were supposed to expect from this movie.If you were expecting a great family movie like ""Up"", then I guess I can see why you were disappointed with the film.But I wasn't disappointed.I thought it was funny, cute, entertaining, and pure fun.It's no masterpiece by any standards, but it is NOT a bad film in any way.The acting isn't great, but it's decent.David Cross also makes a very funny performance this time around.You also have to admit that the CGI for the chipmunks isn't half bad.I'm just at a loss of words at how underrated this movie is.I'm sorry for sounding like I'm repeating myself, but what in the world did you expect from this movie? Were you expecting something so good as if it were from Pixar Studios? Were you expecting something that paid homage to the cartoons.If so and you ended up hating this film, you really have some serious issues.",8
626,I tried to laugh. honest.,"But even the only 19 year old teenager in the audience who lowered his standards all the way down to watching this children's flick says this was a waste of time and film.I recall seeing that theatre packed with children. of course, it was Saturday afternoon. But the sounds of laughing children were about as rare as a steak.In other words, even the kids didn't like the movie.So what goes on? The chipmunks hurt their owner while performing some van halen (rock on) in high pitched tones. so then they have to stay with their grandmother (who also gets hurt) so then they have to stay with toby, who's only care is video gaming. To curb their time, the chipmunks have to go to school. they find their place in school with the singing competition. if they fail, the school's music classes and club will no longer exist.Meanwhile, the arsehole Ian wants vengeance. He finds it in the form of 3 girl chipmunks, called the chipettes. but the chipettes are perfect matches for the chipmunks. this is shown when they meet, along to the song ""I wanna know what love is"" (rock on).The only memorable funny part at which i really didn't have to try to laugh at was when one of the chipmunks broke the TV with the Wii remote. That has become an internet sensation, when some idiot kid doesn't put on the remote strap and throws the remote into the TV.If you hadn't guessed already, the soundtrack is the only good thing about the movie. but anyone can make a good soundtrack.I recommend that you don't watch this movie....at all. Not even a rental.",1
627,Funnier than a lot of kids' movies,I don't understand the severely low rating for this film. 2.7?I was prepared for something awful but wanted to do something with the 4 younger kids before they headed back to school.This is the movie they wanted to see.I've seen a lot of kids' movies and this is definitely among the funnier ones I've seen.My 8-year-old and I sat next to each other and had a hard time controlling our laughter on a few occasions.I told my husband he definitely has to see this when it comes out on video. I can't wait to watch it with him!Give it a try - maybe even risk raising your expectations a little!,7
628,An excellent sequel to a nostalgic piece of cinema that will entertain everyone even if the haven't seen the TV shows,"ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS: THE SQUEAKQUEL, in my opinion, is an excellent sequel to a nostalgic piece of cinema that will entertain everyone even if the haven't seen the TV shows. If you ask me, the music was absolutely fantastic. It's hard for me to decide what the best songs of all were here. I really liked ""You Really Got Me,"" ""You Spin Me 'Round (Like A Record),"" and ""Stayin' Alive"" a lot. I hated Ian (David Cross), though. The reason for this is that because he was pure evil! However, all of the mischief that occurred was funny. The romance and competition was nice, too. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved did a good job. Now, in conclusion, if you haven't seen this excellent sequel to a nostalgic piece of cinema that will entertain everyone even if the haven't seen the TV shows, go rent it or buy it today. I guarantee you that you'll be thoroughly entertained.",10
629,"Not terrible, but not very good","Let's face it: ""The Chipmunks"" is a pretty thin premise. Once you get past the novelty of squeaky voiced animated rodents, there's really not much there. So this movie's straight-line, A to B to C story is a serious drawback.Director Betty Thomas doesn't get a whole lot out of the cast (although, to be honest, I don't expect much in the way of high-caliber acting in movies like this), and the whole thing has a bit of a TV-movie feel, but the animation is rather good, and the film moves moves along at a pretty good clip, so even adults won't get too bored.Certainly, for some reviewers, a film like this, in the final analysis, is perfectly acceptable, since it's ""for kids,"" and thus the only thing that counts is whether it's ""entertaining"" on some basic level, regardless of its actual quality. That's a pretty common attitude toward kids' films, and one that really sells children short, as if they have no interest in character or story. They do, just like anyone else, albeit on a less sophisticated level than (most) adults. For example, I know that a lot of reviewers hated ""Hotel for Dogs"" but that film had an engaging story, well-drawn characters and a story that, while ultimately predictable, still held a few twists and turns. It wasn't particularly good, but it was better than this film.",6
630,"Just a Perfect Waste of Film: Go Home, Talking Chipmunks","You've all seen or heard of the first film, Alvin and the Chipmunks. My suggestion is that they shouldn't have even made a sequel, or in this case, a sqeakuel. Last film was fine: a group of talking chipmunks found and made famous.When I went to watch this at a pre-screening, it was awful: my cousin was asleep, and I was just crying to get out of the theatre. Now, the storyline is awful: those talking chipmunks go to school, and face against some other talking chipmunks in this band contest. In my opinion, I thought that was a really weak storyline.However, this is just a perfect film for small kids. Lessons taught about being considerate to others, being kind, and those other lessons.But as entertainment, I'd rather have watched Barney.",2
631,Cute and entertaining all the way through!,"I have to laugh at the comments about ""not having substance."" Um, this is 'Alvin and the Chipmunks,' right? If you really are concerned about what ""messages"" this movie is sending your children (or....yourself?), then there is a plain, easy-to-grasp theme about family and friends sticking together. I'm not sure what else you want.Beyond that, the film is very cute, funny, and entertaining all the way through. The female-counterpart ""Chipettes"" add something new, but don't take away from the Chipmunks. Zachary Levin and David Cross are charming and amusing in their respective roles. If you liked the first movie, then you will be entertained by the ""squeakquel.""",9
632,"In my opinion, the worst of the series","Well, what can I say? This movie is so boring. The chipmunks start going to school after Dave gets injured at The Chipmunk's concert. For what, when they can already talk and especially sing? Besides, in this movie Dave hires an elderly babysiter who got injured after falling down some stairs while she was in her wheeling chair. Now the chipmunks are with the babysiter's lazy grandson, Toby. Oh yes, at school The Chipmunks met ""The Chippets"". The Chippets are the girl version of The Chipmunks, and now somehow go to the same school now! Ian Hawk was homeless one day and found The Chippets and started to become rich again. Meanwhile, The Chipmunks were losing popularity so they wanted The Chippets to join them instead of being with Ian since he was being so bossy. Towards the end of the movie, there's a talent show for $25,000. The Chipmunks wanted the Chippets to preform with them. But, Ian was gettng ready to take the Chippets to the airport, Alvin drives a toy motercycle to save the girls. After Alvin gets the girls, Ian finds them and drives a toy helecopter. Somehow, they got the remote to the helecopter and was able to drive back to the high school and won the talent show. Dave returns during the talent show and decides to keep The Chippets as 'family"". At the very end, Alvin and Dave flick on and off the lights arguing about school and that Alvin isn't tired to go to bed. Aa Dave tries to come to Alvin when he still has crouches on, Alvin switches the light off and dave slips on a random skateboard and falls. Funny, right? The end!I remember back in 2009, nobody in my theater laughed, except for that scene where Toby does a dutch oven on Thedore. Still, not so funny.",1
633,Great fun for the kids,"I watched this movie this afternoon and although the humour wasn't particularly suited to my tastes it certainly made my 5 year old laugh (aswell as the other kids in the audience).In comparison to the first movie I certainly wouldn't say it was better, it was, however... almost as good. Animaton was spot on, humour was good (not too over done), music choice, like in the first movie was excellent.If you want to put a smile on your kids face this Christmas then you could do a lot worse than Alvin & The Chipmunks.It's worth remembering when commenting on this type of movie that it's a kids film, targeted at an immature audience.Overall, for amusement I would give it 7/10, my 5 year old 10/10",8
634,A fun movie that the kids will enjoy.,"The first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie was alright, but The Squeakquel is better in many ways than the first. For the Squeakquel it has songs, laughs, and brand new competition for Alvin and his brothers.It is already obvious from the previews that the Chipettes are making their debut in the Squeakquel. The way they debut brings back an old enemy of Alvin and his brothers. Ian comes back to cause more trouble. Lying to the Chipettes, putting them up against Alvin and the Chipmunks, and trying to put an end to the Chipmunks singing career once and for all. So now the Chipmunks are going to school and they must compete against the Chipettes for the spot of representing their school in a charity competition so that they can save the school's music program. As Alvin learns that he must choose between his brothers or being the number one star with no one else there to take the spotlight from him.Many new things happen in this movie, bringing new material to build on a sequel that can be pretty good now that everyone has been introduced to the movies. While the movie is enjoyable it seems that children may get more from it than adults would. In the end it is a fun little comedy and musical that a lot of people could enjoy.",8
635,Absolutely Terrible,"This movie was a terrible movie, even for children. I am 15 and had to bring my younger brother to this. Even he didn't enjoy this movie. Watch the three chipmunks attempt to ""survive"" high school. It boggles my mind that people are still pretending that high school is a huge threat. It really isn't anywhere near how bad these unimaginative scriptwriters and directors believe it to be. you love exhausted and clichéd plot-lines, shallow teenage stereotypes, numerous plot-holes galore, and an endless stream of fart and belch jokes, you still won't watch this movie. I wouldn't even recommend this to fans of the original, which was probably about five times better then this garbage. A useless movie that maybe should have been released straight to DVD at best.",1
636,Funny and cute,"Went tonight with the whole family. Laughed quite a lot and so did the kids. The inside jokes were pretty funny. It's a cute, little movie, cleaner than the first one as far as innuendos go. Kids will like it, parents will like that the kids like it and if you have the kind of sense of humor that I do, you will laugh, too! When I read a review about a movie that is meant for teens and adults, I want to know whether it is ridiculous or worth seeing. When I read a review for a kids' movie, I want to know whether it is clean and funny and whether it can teach my kids a lesson or not. This movie WAS clean and funny and taught my kids once again the importance of family and keeping your word. Why can't that be enough? Why does a kids' movie have to have lots of substance? Why can't it just be cute and sweet,like the TV show was all those years ago? ""We're the Chipmunks,C-H-I-P-M-U-N-K! We're the Chipmunks, guaranteed to brighten your day!"" :-)",8
637,"Fun movie, good comedy.","No, this isn't the best or funniest comedy in the world, but I certainly enjoyed it.  There is a fair amount of really good comedy in the film to keep you entertained.  ...And of course there's Elizabeth Hurley...need I say more?The story is a fun one and quite the fantasy, but nonetheless, it's entertaining.  While not being anything terribly profound, this film definitely has a point to make, be happy with yourself and only you can make things happen, don't rely on others for your happiness.The acting in this film is very good.  Brendan Fraser struts his acting talent in this film quite nicely, playing virtually 5 or 6 characters throughout the film.  Brendan really is a talented actor and should get some notice for his role in this film.  Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss also deserve a great deal of notice for their work in this film, all three of them play various types of characters in the film and do it quite nicely.  Elizabeth Hurley and her ever-changing wardrobe should be reason enough for any guy to watch this film.  She looks nothing short of fantastic in every scene.  Frances O'Connor was a nice choice for the part of Alison / Nicole (also playing more than one role very nicely).All in all, this is a fun, cute movie with some really good comedy.  I would recommend this film to anyone that likes those types of film, or is just a fan of one of the actors or director Harold Ramis.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,-Chris",9
638,'George Of The Jungle' Meets Satan,"Here's a fun film with a number of good laughs. It is stupid? Yeah, in parts. Is the theology sound? Hardly, but there was more truth than fiction uttered in this film, believe it or not. Is the Devil made to look attractive? Well, yeah, I'd say Elizabeth Hurley is pretty attractive!The beginning is the best part of the film, and the end - with a dumb New Age message - is the worst. Along the way, the dumb Brendan Fraser's ""Elliott Richards"" learns some valuable lessons in his battle with the Devil. For selling his soul, so to speak, he gets seven wishes and we witness how he handles, or mishandles, these wishes. Much of it is pretty funny. Fraser is not a bad. He can play these goofy roles (i.e. ""George Of The Jungle"" and he can get serious and be effective, too, as in ""The Quiet American."")Overall, it's good lightweight entertainment. Don't expect much, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. At least, that's the way I found it.",8
639,"A comedy with warmth, wit, and style","I originally saw this movie because it stars Brendan Fraser, an actor who can't seem to make a bad movie, and often makes great movies, such as ""Blast From the Past"".The big surprise was Elizabeth Hurley. As certain as Vivien Leigh was meant to play Scarlett O'Hara, no one could have done a better job playing The Devil...in this case a sly, brilliantly cunning, sexy devil who playfully torments Brendan by dooming each of his wishes with unintended, nasty surprises. She effortlessly leads him along like a puppy dog on a leash.Besides her comedic wit, (and some clever writing) I would be remiss not to mention that Elizabeth Hurley looks perfect, absolutely perfect, in every scene. Her clipped, refined British accent is the aural equivalent of a film shot on Kodachrome.Bedazzled exudes a positive, good-natured warmth, and is proof that comedy doesn't have to depend on silly sophomoric antics, pratfalls, or foul language.ADDENDUM January 10, 2008. After two years, I have no idea if anyone has ever read this review. Even if you don't like it, please give me a thumbs up or thumbs down, just to let me know someone read it.",9
640,Hurley and O'Connor in the same movie? There must be a God!,"""Bedazzled"" tells of a tech support geek (need I say more?) who sells his soul to the devil (Hurley) for seven wishes which he attempts to use to get close to a girl at work (O'Connor). The flick is a situational comedy which takes the audience on a fun ride as Fraser's wishes turn him into one exaggerated comic-book-type caricature after another. A cute flick sans slapstick, pratfalls, and jokes, ""Bedazzled"" offers lots of outrageous situations, some sentimental moments, and a whiff of philosophy. A fun watch with a cute ending, lots of eye candy for the guys, and Fraser doing what he does best playing a big, naive, smiling guy.",7
641,"""It's not easy being the Barbra Streisand of evil.""","Even though Elizabeth Hurley plays The Devil she is a goddess.Brendan Fraser is certainly adequate to the job of playing Elliot Richards but Ms. Hurley steals the film.She is perfectly cast as the `Princess of Darkness' and seems to truly enjoy exposing her darker side.Brendan Fraser turns in a real acting tour d'force playing eight different characters.  Possibly because of all the widely divergent characters he is playing he is not truly great in any of them  though he is hysterically funny  due primarily to the superb script by Larry Gelbart (of television's M*A*S*H fame), Harold Ramis (who also directed) and Peter Tolan from the original screen play by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.The Devil's demons (which appear in nearly every scene in one form or another) are great supporting roles played by Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein and Toby Huss.  They provide just the right touch of devilish humour, charm and wit.  Another bit of casting genius and writing is Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's cellmate who expounds on the soul and is later seen playing chess with The Devil (who cheats, of course).In fact all of the supporting characters were perfectly cast and brilliantly executed.The script was so tight and well written that it was almost actor-proof.  It was even able to carry a moral message without slamming the audience in the head with it.To paraphrase an idea from the film you get out of life [and this film] what you put into it.This was an all-around good film with good direction, good jokes, good acting, excellent make-up (especially on Brendan Fraser by Ben Nye, Jr.) and a good yet unobtrusive score.  I recommend it highly.",9
642,"Basic comedy,great character acting","The makers of Bedazzled were not out to make a classic comedy,they were simply trying to make us laugh.Their mission was a successful one.Bedazzled is full of laughs and great character acting by Brendan Fraser and Frances O'Connor.After many forgettable roles in several forgettable films,Brendan Fraser has really graduated into one of cinemas' big time players in just the last couple of years.As I said,Bedazzled will probably not go down as a comedy classic,it's just your basic comedy filled with laughs from start to finish,and that's good enough for me.It would be a worthy addition to the comedy section of anyone's home library.Thumbs up!",7
643,Fraser is funny and Hurley is sexy as hell. What more do you want?,"This Harold Ramis movie is a remake of a 60's cult movie which I have never actually seen. It's based on the Faust legend where we have a terminally annoying man who is in love with a girl who works in the same office as him but who barely knows he exists. After a humiliating encounter with her he inadvertently casts up the devil who grants him seven wishes in his quest to win the girl over. The set-up in this one results in a film with a very episodic structure. With the central character wishing to be different in various ways which leads him to be reincarnated as a South American drug lord, a man intensely in touch with his sensitive side, a colossal basketball player, a respected writer, and the President of the USA. The fun comes from the fact that the devil has sneaked in a catch to every new persona and this inevitably leads to disasters for the central character and some hilarity for us. And that's the thing, it's actually a genuinely laugh out loud funny movie on several occasions, some standout moments being the over-sensitive man unable to avoid crying at a sunset or the half-witted giant basketball player who can't seem to string a sentence together without saying 'pretty good' while sweat literally pours from his head. Brendan Fraser is key to the comedy here. He puts in a genuinely good comic turn in a role that allows him to play a variety of characters with the help of some amusing make-up.So far so good. But I thought I would devote the whole final paragraph to the actual best thing about Bedazzled and that can be described in two words - Elizabeth Hurley. Honest to goodness, her performance as the devil is so incredibly seductive its bordering on being criminal. This astronomically gorgeous woman pops up throughout the course of the movie in an array of mind-bogglingly provocative costumes (proving conclusively that it isn't just gay men who can appreciate excessive costume changes). Hurley puts in an extremely sexy performance without stripping off at all which was quite an achievement all things considered. I really like girls with English accents and Hurley's posh voice was simply the icing on this particular cake for yours truly. She isn't a gifted actress but she does all right with comedy roles and this one, needless to say, suits her down to a tee in every conceivable way. Despite its other good qualities, if you made the decision to watch this film for the sole reason of watching our Liz in full throttle, I would understand.",8
644,"Get thee in front of me, Satan.","Elizabeth Hurley, still best known for her '90s relationship with Hugh Grant, and Brendan Fraser, star of Furry Vengeance, team up for this 2000 remake of Dudley Moore and Peter Cook's acerbic 1967 comedy Bedazzled: it sounds like a recipe for disaster, but even though the style of comedy is far removed from the original, Bedazzled 2000 succeeds in delivering its fair share of laughs, as well plenty of sexiness courtesy of Hurley.Fraser plays social pariah Elliot, who finds it hard to make friends and can only dream of a relationship with the apple of his eye, work colleague Alison (Frances O'Connor). When Elliot says that he would do anything to have Alison in his life, the Devil (Hurley) seizes the opportunity and offers the luckless loser seven wishes in exchange for his soul. What follows is a series of comedic episodes that see Fraser adopting numerous different guises, allowing the actor to surprise the audience with his versatility (Fraser is almost unrecognisable at times), while Hurley is predictably wooden, but distracts the viewer by slipping into several very sexy outfits for the connecting interludes.Of course, the devil being the devil, none of Elliot's wishes go according to plan, which leads to some very funny situations for the hapless dork, all of which are confidently handled by director Harold Ramis. This being a Hollywood film, it all works out well in the end for Elliot, who beats the princess of darkness at her own game thanks to his selfless heart, before finding love, not with Alison, but with her dorky doppelganger who just happens to have moved in next door.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for giving me the phrase 'small, wet, salty badges of emotional truth' and for Hurley's amazing array of hotter-than-hell get-ups, which include sexy nurse, sexy traffic warden, sexy cop, sexy teacher, sexy cheerleader, sexy bikini, sexy angel, sexy lawyer, and, in the deleted 'rock star' scene, sexy maid.",7
645,Bedazzled,"I watched this film with low expectations, thinking it was just going to be Elizabeth Hurley (who I always think is underrated) in lots of revealing outfits.And yes, there is a fair bit of that, but there is more. This is actually a very funny film with some nice messages along the way.Good fun, well worth checking out.",7
646,It's cute,"I never saw the original ""Bedazzled"", so I can't compaire really. To tell the truth, I didn't even know there was an original. But I thought this ""Bedazzled"" was very good. Elizabeth Hurly makes a great devil. She's sexy, funny, and intelligent. Brandon Frasier does a good job as well with his stereotypical roles. Caveman, tough guy, and now a nerd. Nothing oscar material. But he always does his best, despite that I think he'll never get out of these roles. ""Bedazzled"" has some funny moments. I would recommend this if it's a rainy day. Other than that, it's nothing too special you'd make time for. But I would recommend it.7/10",7
647,Bedazzled,"This is quite an amusing comedy about the life of an ordinary guy who has his life changed. Ordinary and unpopular Elliot Richards (Brendan Fraser) does not have any real friends, and now he is in love with a work mate Alison Gardener (Frances O'Connor). He tells God ""I would do anything to have that girl"", and instead, he gets his wish from The Devil (Elizabeth Hurley). She says he has seven wishes (like seven deadly sins) if he sells his soul. He also has a dialler to phone 666 (the Devil's sign) if his wish isn't going the way he wants. Throughout, he wishes to be many different personalities, including (unintentionally) a powerful Spanish drug dealer, an overly-sensitive nature lover, a professional basketball player with a ""little"" problem, a great book writer who turns out to be gay and President Abrham Lincoln, all wishes certain to have something go wrong, it's the Devil, what do you expect? When he gets to his final wish he does not want it and he eventually gets let off after a non-personal wish. In the end, it turns out it is not Alison that he was to be with, but a lookalike with dark hair named Nicole (yes, it's still O'Connor). Also starring Orlando Jones as Daniel, Paul Adelstein as Bob, Toby Huss as Jerry and Gabriel Casseus as Elliot's Cellmate. It may be cheesy at times, and not have the biggest laughs, but it's still fun to watch. Good!",6
648,Making a pact with the devil can be fun,"In ""Bedazzled"", Brendan Fraser stars as Elliot, a likable loser who tries hard but just doesn't have many friends, and he hopelessly pines for Allison (Frances O'Connor). Then the devil shows up. The devil is Elizabeth Hurley in sexy outfits who, in exchange for his soul, will grant him wishes.This is a comedy, which is fairly funny with a number of witty lines and a few clever concepts. There are of course comedic mishaps each time the devil grants him a wish and it doesn't play out as he expected. The movie plays as a series of vignettes joined together and introduced with Elliot making another wish with the devil. It can seem disjointed if you don't like vignette-type films.Brendan Fraser is finally playing the type of role he is meant to play as a hopeless dweeb and morphs into his other characters with comedy. Elizabeth Hurley is, in one word, sexy. She is, in all senses, the devil.""Bedazzled"" is occasionally over the top, but then again, we are making a pact with the devil. The devil is certainly known to distort the truth, except this time it really is enjoyable fun.",7
649,Liz Hurley is one sexy Devil,"Elliot Richardson is not the most dynamic of protagonists; he is the sort of guy who tries too hard to be popular making him more annoying than likable and the woman he loves, co-worker Alison, is barely aware that he exists. Then one day he says he'd do anything if she would like him the next thing he knows a stunning woman, who claims to be the Devil, offers him seven wishes in exchange for his soul. He doesn't take much persuasion. Unfortunately while his wishes are granted they aren't quite granted how he'd hoped; for example he wants to be rich, powerful and married to Alison he becomes a drug lord, she is having an affair and hates him. The other wishes are similarly disastrous and ultimately he realises that perhaps making selfish wishes isn't a good way to get what you want.Having not seen the original version I can't say how this compares. Brendan Fraser is decent enough as protagonist Elliot; unfortunately the character is neither particularly likable nor memorable. Liz Hurley stands out far more as possibly the sexiest version of The Devil on screen helped by costumes that show off her attributes without going beyond what is acceptable in a 12 Certificate film. The story is fun enough but very episodic; each wish leads to what is effectively a short sketch. There are enough funny moments spread throughout the film even if some of them are a bit obvious. The ending is a bit twee but not enough to spoil the film. Overall this was fun enough but not really a must see.",6
650,"Loopy humor, down-to-earth wisdom","Someone in Movie Heaven dropped a feather down on Ramis, the director of such good time romps as Ghostbusters and Stripes. His remake of this 1967 classic rides on the slumped shoulders of Elliot (Brendan Fraser at his best), a pathetically geeky loner who is so socially unskilled that he makes our skin crawl a little. When we first meet him, Elliot is trying to glom onto his co-workers' after-hours social scene by using such tried-and-true means as showing photos of his speakers (from all sides), a truly awful blue-eyed soul brother act, and plain old stalking.Even though he is the guy you run from when he lurches towards you in the hall - probably knocking over the water cooler at the same time - Elliot really does want to be different. One reason for this is his fervent secret crush on Alison (Frances O'Connor), a beautiful systems analyst who doesn't see him at all. Elliot is so smitten by her that he doesn't even realize until too late that she has given him a polite brush off at the local pub, where he is busy trying to impress his buddies.Now comes a simple but nifty transitional shot: a cue ball skips off a pool table and bounces down a flight of stairs and the camera follows as it makes a steady, inevitable trip across the crowded floor, pairs of feet yielding right of way as it goes on to finally hit Elliot's feet where he sits on a stool in silent yearning. He picks up the ball and looks across the room, up the flight of stairs to where destiny, in the form of Elizabeth Hurley in a slinky red dress, is beckoning him.Ms. Hurley is actually the Devil, although Elliot doesn't know it yet, and she will shortly be putting him through a series of transformative experiences. In the meantime, though, he isn't buying her story, even though she presents him with a card that reads, ""The Devil"". Contrasted with the heavy-handedness of recent 'Sign O'the Beast R' Us' flicks such as Devil's Advocate, this sequence is done with sly understatement and depends simply on giving Hurley a chance to play the vamp she was born to be.We begin to like Elliot here because, even though he is presented with a slew of vanity-pleasing enticements, it isn't until she serves up a batch of his grandmother's cookies that he believes the Devil is really who she claims to be. And when he is presented with the standard seven-wishes-for-your-soul contract, it isn't until he sees a giant video screen of Alison calling to him that he makes the deal.Although the real treats - the deliriously goofy incarnations of teeth, hair and clothing that Elliot chooses for his ideal self in his endless quest for happiness, success, and Alison's hand - are yet to come, I am just pointing out how masterfully Ramis has set the table. By the time he is plunged into his voyage of self-improvement, we already know a great deal about Elliot and have begun to move into his corner.We've also begun to feel a certain sympathy for the Devil, thanks mainly to the fine work of Ms. Hurley, with her elegant voice and her clear zest for the role. Although she is certainly not the scariest Lucifer yet to appear on screen, she is one of the most persistently sales-oriented and could hang with the toughest of David Mamet's phone scammers. By turns sultry, pitiful, and practical (""Have you ever even seen your soul? Do you even know what it does? It's really just like your appendix - you'll never miss it.""), she is always the ultimate Closer. Yet it's also never really in doubt that those with a glimmer of goodness can slip the bonds of her contract with no hard feelings on her part.Fraser's Elliot, who is almost always the dupe, is hilariously baffled by the persona the Devil has given him. Plagued in each adventure by the same guys who torment him at the office, he can never figure out what has gone wrong with his wish until it is too late. It's delightful to see this fine actor strutting the comic range he is capable of playing in all of his character's various selves, as well as the simplicity with which he returns to being the same old Elliot, wiser, at the end.Fine supporting work by Orlando Wilson, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss as Elliot's co-workers and karmic cast members. Great script by Ramis, Larry Gelbart of M.A.S.H. and Oh, God, and Peter Tolan (Analyze This, The Larry Sanders Show).",10
651,Elizabeth Hurley was a Hot DEVIL!!,"This film was very entertaining and lots of laughs, and you can hardly be critical of a film which is meant to be UNBELIVEABLE!!! Stories about the devil and the wishes he or she grants is always an eye catcher, the struggle between Good & Evil.  Elizabeth Hurley (The Devil),""Bad Boy"",'02 was very sexy as a devil and almost kept Brendon Fraser(Elliot Richards),""Monkey Bone"",'01 from meeting his true love Francis O'Connor,(Alison Gardner),""Book of Love"",'04. Elliot truly loved Alison and even told the devil,""I JUST WANT ALISON TO HAVE A HAPPY LIFE"", which made The Devil quite mad.   If you just want to enjoy a film and be entertained, don't miss this crazy comedy!",10
652,One of my guilty pleasures,"This film is one of my guilty pleasures. You know, one of those films that you shouldn't really like but actually do. I guess it helps that I've always had a bit of a thing about Liz Hurley and her role here as the devil suits her perfectly, and her limitations as an actress don't really matter here.The other main character and another good looking woman is Frances O'Connor as Alison. She's lovely and a great actress here. In addition, Orlando Jones, Paul Adelstein, and Toby Huss play a variety of characters very nicely.Brendan Fraser holds the whole thing together. He plays nerdy Elliot, who works with Alison though he is invisible to her. He says he would give anything to have her as a girlfriend. This is an invitation for the devil to offer him seven wishes in exchange for his soul... as long as he signs the contract.There follow five very funny cameos where Elliot takes different personas in order to win Alison. Each is doomed to end in failure. He asks to be (1) rich and powerful, (2) emotionally sensitive, (3) a famous athlete, (4) intelligent, witty and well-endowed, (5) President of the United States. Every scenario has a twist that he did not expect. The devil gives Elliot misleading advice in her own cameos between these scenes.Some reviewers have compared this version unfavourably to the Peter Cook & Dudley Moore version. It's best not to compare them. The films are sufficiently different to enjoy each one in its own right.There are many scenes here that are laugh-out-loud, even on a repeat viewing. If there's a weak point it's the final half hour. Yes it does sort of tie the whole thing together but the pace slows and it tries too hard for a 'happy ever after' finish. Maybe a darker ending would have been better. But overall, great fun, great dialogue and great acting.",9
653,A Bit of a Laugh,"A remake of the 1967 Classic with Dudley Moore and Peter Cook. Replaced with Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley respectively this version fails to be as clever or as sinister as the original, but it still entertains and Elizabeth Hurley is the sexiest devil you'll ever see.Brendan Fraser (Elliot Richards) is a hapless geek, who dreams of only Alison Gardner (Frances O'Conner) and with the help of the Devil (Elizabeth Hurley) he has 7 wishes to try and get her, the trouble is the Devil has other plans.Pretty funny with some nice ideas Bedazzled is good, but not as good as the original.6/10",6
654,"Great Photography and Skating, but Jumpy and Hard to Follow","Miwa, a 40-year old woman, a figure skating teacher, faces challenging choices about her professional future as well as encountering a young girl, whose father comes from a past relationship. Technical problems with the Amazon subtitles made watching this movie without prejudice difficult. However, the film's own editing seemed choppy and somewhat disjointed making the ability to comprehend what was going on more tedious and distracting while trying to just enjoy the film experience. There is also perhaps some cultural issues that arose with the challenge of the legal relationship between mother and the child as well as the professional career choices that arise in the movie. There's a personal choice dilemma from the past between individual happiness and Olympic aspirations, relationships, and confronting the present choices of parenting and the Olympics. Compared to The Cutting Edge (1992) , there's a focus in Coach on a paternal as well as handling multiple responsibilities and roles and might be considered at odds with American values. In contrast there is even a comparison could make with the boxing classic Rocky (1976) as well as a martial art and even a blue rose element. Or contrast Coach with No Reservations (2007) about a female chef confronted with a young child in a romantic comedy and how the relationship evolves and how it folds into the story. As a result, rating this movie becomes unusually somewhat subjected a cultural perspective. Additionally, there are small scenes that don't seem to fit, such as one of Miwa's older male students is informed that she needs to take some time off from her teaching but at this point in the movie one would assume that the student would be quite aware of the reason why. Even the motivation for Miwa's decisions seems to be given short shrift. There are occasionally some great, brief intimate elements, especially as they relate to family relationships. Additionally, the movie includes some nice film time on actual skating without apparent stunt doubles which is quite a refreshing and a challenging change. Overall, however, this movie just seems overly and unnecessarily difficult to follow in this presentation even as the movie's cinematography and performances are executed with icy and great technical precision.",7
655,"For Vishal n Shahid, with love n respect!","Vishal Bhardwaj is back after Haider(2014) with a love triangle set in the era of world war 2. He was saying in promotion that this is his first love story while most of his work before this was containing love story as a backdrop. I was amazed to here this. But after seeing the trailer, I made up my mind that this film is gonna be a Love Story. I was waiting for 24th February since November. You can not believe me but it's true that it was really hard for me to sleep last night. As I'm a huge Vishal Bhardwaj and Shahid Kapoor fan. The curiosity level was damn high. So I went to watch 9 am show.Movie starts with a tiny but very well captured war sequence. Then moves towards the film industry situated in Bombay. Rustam is a film producer, as well as lover of his heroine Julia. He has been approached by British Officer to arrange a special show of Julia and her band for Indian soldiers working for Britishers. For the purpose of security of Miss Julia, Britishers have arranged Nawab Malik. Journey starts from Bombay to Rangoon in train, but because of a tragedy, Julia and Nawab Malik get closer to each other. Their love makes the way to end or not is the question. Other questions are also there (like some kind of suspense) which we will get to know in post interval part. If I talk about story, then till interval I was enjoying a good stuff by Vishal. At the moment of interval, Alvida song was playing, and I was just into that. I just loved it! Post interval there are moments, but Julia and her train sequence was the best part. Ending could have been more justified or you can say more detailed. It was cleared but not so much effective. The visuals could have been better I guess. If this is your dream project, than you don't let it go anyway like this. I know i am revealing much, but, I felt it so.Okay, now only positive talk! Direction and camera-work were as usual like we had seen in Haider. But the Kashmir and its snow were missing. Arunachal was good, but not my cup of tea. Dialogues were good. Shahid and Kangna's dialogues were lovey. Officer's dialogues were the biggest plus point, as they were witty as well as very well spoke. Some Ghalib's couplets from his mouth was a funny thing to see!Saif Ali Khan delivers an easy performance. He is the perfect choice for Rustam. Kangna is good, but I don't like her in Dancing moves. Supporting cast is superb. All actors and supporters are fine enough. Ye Ishq Hai, Miyan Gaye England, Bloody Hell, Alvida- all are fantastic. Gulzar Saa'b's lyrics are too good. I like Jan Gan Man by Bhardwaj. It gave me goose bumps. Kissing scenes are best! No one can imagine how to capture a kiss like Vishal has done. I think he is more romantic than serious deep inside his heart. I guess that's why he can compose such a romantic numbers with a great melody. If you compare this film film with his last film Haider, than for me, it is not that good. Haider was the best film of that year. This is good film, can be there in nominees, but I doubt of its winning. It has many things missing. But for me, many positive vibes the film has been offering since beginning, the climax ruined all. I'm not opposing the script, but I don't like the visuals.On the whole, Rangoon is a dream project of Vishal. So his fans out there, please go and watch it. Make this film his biggest hit at box office. He is one of the creative and intelligent directors of India. You have to give him what he deserves. This film belongs to him. And this film without its STAR could never been possible. Yes, Nawab Malik aka Shahid Kapoor is at his best. After Haider, Tommy Singh in Udta Punjab and now this film, he is on role! I hope this film gets him another award. He is going higher and higher. No one can give competition to him now as his cinema and his acting skills, both are extremely high. Kudos to Mr. Kapoor.For Vishal Bhardwaj and Shahid Kapoor, with Love and Respect 8/10.",8
656,Hamlet versus Hamlet,"I watched Rangoon on Netflix. Since I knew my beloved Japanese actor Satoru Kawaguchi will appear this film, I had been eagerly waiting for this day. (Incidentally, it has not been screened in Japan yet!)The synopsis of Rangoon is so epic. Love, War, Deceit... there are completely wrapped in beautiful screen images and music. From the beginning to the end, I felt my heart beating so fast. Especially, expressive Julia and stoic Nawab Malik... their appearance that two hearts melt in love is so emotional and heartwarming, but on the other hand I became saddened by the feeling of the tragedy.Satoru as their prisoner Hiromichi, he played the role of bonding lovers, was surprisingly perfectly. He gives a heartfelt performance as a soldier who is never strong and wants to go back to his mother, and his honest acting and comic timing are surely the jewels in his crown.By the way, before watching this film, I was worried about how the Japanese army would be drawn in this tale. Its canvas is the Burma campaign during World War II. Even though I knew that Shahid Kapoor would play a BIA soldier, I could not think that Japanese would be drawn a villain.I was excited to the utmost in the fight scene between Nawab and Hiromichi. Both of them were not villains and desperately trying to live in the wartime. Although each of them masterpieces were Hamlet, both had surpassed themselves. Exactly, Hamlet versus Hamlet. I was so glad because my favorite film is Shahid's Haider and of course I adore Satoru deeply.The scene where Hiromichi left there, was the most impressive. I have never seen a film which Japanese true colors accurately drawn as much as Rangoon. Kill or shame... he was suffering between honor and friendship. So sad, that was wartime. So I think Director Vishal Bhardwaj is awesome who can draw foreign souls.Also I found a brilliant actor in this film. Kangana Ranaut... How attractive she is! Her innocent smile, eyes that talk too much, adorable action, dance... I'm sure that there is no same feelings on her face as one regardless of which frame in chosen. She is the best actress I have ever watched, and I guess Rangoon further amplified her charm.However, there were parts which I did not like. In the same director's work Haider, I found reality in fiction. But in Rangoon, the climax where Julia goes to help her lover has lost reality. Of course I understand that Julia and her ex Rusi are excellent action star, but I wanted to see a scene where Julia and Nawab are joined together in the beautiful river. There are many entertainment films in the world, but I like socially which is the feature of sir Vishal.Still I love this film. Rangoon, I have a soft spot for there. I learned English to watch this, and as a result, saw the landscape of India I had never seen before, heard beautiful music, knew the history of war. And I made friends of foreigners, my life became rich by talking with them. Thanks a lot of happiness, Team Rangoon, I will never forget your amazing work and two Hamlet's chemistry!",9
657,Well tried Vishal Bhardwaj but need more focus on script.,"Vishal Bhardwaj directed again in Shakespearean style War and Love triangle saga to give tribute to Azad Hind Fauj like he directed Maqbool, Omkara and Haider Movie. Kangana Ranaut is the USP of this movie as there is just good performance from Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor. Good Music created by Vishal and Gulzar sahab. There was so many songs which break the pace of the drama. Only Bloody Hell, Ye Ishq Hain and Mere MIyan gaye England were good to listen. Script need to be better treatment as there was more Dance or Performances of Julia but Pankaj Kumar's Cinematography is also good ingredient. As movie has collected 6 crores on day 1 so it seems 40-50 crores will be lifetime collection.",7
658,Could have been better,"Vishal Bhardwaj when comes to film making has a vision that is illustrated in his earlier ventures. The music in his movies always stand apart this could also be seen, as a highlight in this undertaking. Rangoon is set up in the pro-independence India. This movie is different from his earlier Shakespearean outings Haider, Omkara and Maqbool. The Cinematography is excellent. The music is as usual the high point of the movie. Leading cast is excellent, with Saif again portraying frightening and is reminiscent of langda Tyagi from Omkara.Shaid deserves an applaud not as superlative performance as in Haider but still top notch.Kangna again shows why she is considered as a queen of Bollywood . She dances and manages action sequences with ease. The movie keeps the viewers engrossed throughout. The patriotic song Jan Gan man infuses patriotism when played and beautifully composed by Vishal. Than what is the issue with this flick? The problem lies in the script of this movie. The last 20 to 25 minutes of the movie struggles and make it tedious for the viewers.The climax is elongated and gives an unscrupulous taste to the movie. Overall an highly ambitious project from Vishal but the climax could have been glossy and absorbing which has always been a forte of his earlier movies. Also, regulars in Bhardwaj's flicks the likes Irfan Khan and KK Menon are missed. Overall a good watch",7
659,"But, BLOODY HELL ... it, still, is a GREAT WATCH !!","Rangoon is set in 1943, when the British colonials in India were fighting the advancing Japanese and Netaji Bose's Azad Hind Army on the country's north east along the Myanmar border and a resurgent freedom struggle under Mahatma across the country. On this wide and raging canvas, Vishal Baradwaj crafts a love triangle involving a clutch of plucky characters. Rusi (Saif Ali Khan) a Parsi aristocrat and an erstwhile action hero whose career was cut short by an accident where he loses a hand and becomes a movie producer. Nawab Mallik (Shahid Kapoor) is jamadar in the British Indian army. And, then there is Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), a daredevil movie star who complements the incomplete lives of both these men.Kangana is fabulous as the pioneering action star of her times and is able to ace a role which is physically as well as emotionally demanding. She owns this part and explores its innocence, action, romance, confusions, arrogance, vulnerability as well obsession with aplomb. Shahid is excellent as the sincere jamadar Nawab Mallik who is torn between his mission and his love for Miss Julia. Saif is a natural as a bruised aristocrat who is driven to desperation to salvage his life and love slipping away. Of the competent supporting cast, the notable performances are from Saharsh Shukla as Zulfi, Miss Julia's make-up man and confidante and Richard McCabe as the British General Harding with a taste for Urdu poetry.
After completing his spectacular trilogy of Shakespearean tragedies with Maqbool, Omkara and Haider, in Rangoon, Vishal Bharadwaj presents an ambitious period drama set against the second world war and packs in a potent mixture of love, action, jealousy, deceit and more through lush visuals of Pankaj Kumar.Vishal Bhardwaj also excels as the music director as he delivers a background score that accentuates the moods of the movie even as continues his fruitful collaboration with Gulzar and the duo have come up with some wonderful songs.Rangoon, thus, presents quite a heady cocktail of fine performances, several stand-out sequences such as the conversation between Kangana and a captured Japanese soldier, both glib in their own languages, trademark humour, some great dialogues, superb songs and captivating cinematography. Yet, one feels that there is something amiss which stops it short of being a masterpiece that it seeks to be. The romance does not exactly set the screen afire, the narrative fabric couldn't consistently weave together the multiple strands, the length could have been a tad trimmer or perhaps, the finale could have been much more nuanced.",7
660,Nothing like Rangoon from Hindi cinema in recent times,"Like many Bharadwaj movies, Rangoon is well-suited to audiences willing to use imagination/ thought to appreciate the complexities of the characters he depicts and the worlds he creates. The on-going fever in Bollywood is movies with ""strong"" female characters. By contrast, Rangoon gives us a female character who is a captive of another man and is weak, confused and vulnerable. Bharadwaj is not interested is presenting us with a caricature that would be loved and cheered by audiences or, for that matter, critics, who have senselessly come to expect an actor of the caliber of Ranaut to always assay strong female characters. His interests lie is depicting the brutal truth of how female employees have sometimes been treated by their male employers – and this truth can really extend beyond employment. He is interested in showing the havoc that captivity can inflict on the psyches of captives, be they a single individual or a whole nation. Note how Julia, as a stunt-woman, possesses the strength and skills to physically save a man's life. However, she is mentally and emotionally weak. Bharadwaj is interested in emphasizing this difference between physical strength gained by practicing certain skills, and emotional/ mental strength. That Bharadwaj can depict this dichotomy so beautifully is evidence of his immense skills as a filmmaker.Bharadwaj also draws parallels between the captivity of a female by a seemingly adoring yet absolutely domineering male employer, aka Rusi, and the captivity of a nation by a race that while liking her local culture believe in their own superiority, aka Harding. (Audiences may be aware of the ""burden of white man"" remarks of the Nobel winning author of The Jungle Book, Rudyard Kipling). At one point, Nawab makes a pointed remark about the psychology of the captive race when he states "" perhaps that is why we are slaves of the white man."" The film tops it off by digging into the reasons for Rusi's domineering attitude.Despite being the most interesting, Julia's is a relatively straightforward character in the plot - a far-cry from Ranaut's previous outings. Julia remains a weak and vulnerable female character from beginning to the end. However, it is by no means an easy role in terms of the range of emotions Ranaut has to depict, and she also gets to showcase her skills in dancing and on-screen action. Once again, Ranaut proves that she is one of the best that Hindi cinema has ever seen. I particularly enjoyed the sword face-off between Julia and Rusi. Saif Ali Khan, as Julia's domineering employer Rusi, gives one of the finest performances by a male actor in Hindi cinema in recent times. Be helplessness when he sees Julia slip away, jealousy/ anger when he encounters Nawab, or confusion when in dilemma between the British and the patriots, his expressions are point on. Shahid Kapoor provides sufficient credibility to the character of Nawab Malik, the soldier who steals Julia's heart away and starts a chain of faux patriotism. Richard McCabe as Major General David Harding is sufficiently menacing and fun to watch. Saharsh Shukla as Zulfi and Lin Laishram as Mema are pitch- perfect in their crucial roles.Let's talk about why you are in for a big loss if you do not watch this movie on the big screen: 1. VB's imagination: The movie provides Vishal Bharadwaj a blank canvas on which he paints mind-blowing and memorable images, with attention to the minutest details. India in the era of 1940s comes alive on screen. 2. Cinematography: From breathtaking shots of outdoor Arunachal locales to engrossing shots of parties, the cinematography provides an undeniably strong support to the film. 3. Production Design: Well-researched and exquisite sets transport you to India and Burma of the 1940s. 4. Performances: This is easily one of the best ensembles in a Hindi movie in recent times and several close-ups of Julia's and Rusi's visages call for big-screen viewing. 5. War scenes: There are not many of these, but the few that exist are breathtaking.Having said all things nice, let me point out a few things that, in my mind, hold this movie from becoming a masterpiece. 1. Emphasis on pre- interval half: Make no mistake, the movie is as much a war-time drama as it is a ""love triangle"". The movie should have focused more on the central plot, majority of which occurs in the second half. Some unnecessary threads in the first half (such as the beginning war scene or the Japanese captive episode) could have been easily shaved off. 2. Crowding of characters in the film: The movie should have focused on the four protagonists (Julia, her lovers, and the British general) and the essential side-characters such as Zulfi and Mema. Presence of dispensable characters such as the Maharaja and the Japanese captive muddies the plot. 3. Ambiguous depiction of Julia's character: Julia is the most vulnerable character in the film. Though well-trained in stunt skills, and having a couple of ""coming-of-age"" moments, Julia never really achieves full independence as a free-thinking human in the film. Therefore, having an ode-song devoted to her character early-on in the movie is somewhat misleading, particularly for audiences who are not familiar with VB's Shakespearean style, leading to disappointment later. 4. Unnecessary use of background music: For example, silence would have been way more effective at the point where Nawab and Julia discover the mine in the trench. 5. Some incredibility of the climax: For the most part, the climax is a fitting finale for the characters the movie has invested in building. However, a certain feat performed by one character could have been more credible had we seen them perform it earlier in the film. Also, the climax does not allow sufficient time for the characters to depict their new leanings on- screen.Do not miss this great Bollywood spectacle while still in theaters.",10
661,Toofan ki Beti,"Rangoon - quite a movie! It's an action film, make no mistake about it. And it has generous dollops of epic romance, fortitude and a plethora of human emotions that all the characters wear on their sleeves. This is not a film that relies on symbolism or on subtlety. Quite in-your-face, this is a film set during the tumultuous times of the Indian Independence and the Second World War on a grand scale. What I really liked about the film is Vishal Bhardwaj's evident love of film-making that came out in the period-piece sets during Kangana's shooting of the wild Toofan Ki Beti. The sets, shooting styles evoked a heady mix of nostalgic 40's films with raucous action and macho heroines. The heady aroma of pop-culture was replete throughout the scenes, especially in Miss Julia's super heroine costume where she jumps like a skilled acrobat onto a chandelier and escapes with a hapless damsel against various goons. Her escape is nothing short of spectacular – high-kicks in leather- clad boots, followed by punches, an escape on a motorcycle that culminates in a high-flying sortie on a warplane. This is solid action and I could not help but wonder of the film within the film that - what was the sensational story of Toofan Ki Beti? The character of Miss Julia is the fulcrum – the character around which the situations revolve, but soon the war engulfs all. Like a bildungsroman, Miss Julia, a super heroine in the reel world, grows into maturity in her love for Nawab, into a super heroine in her own right. The culmination is poetic, and some might say, even clichéd, when she dons her costume one last time to save the love of her life. That her love is doomed and that the war finally subsumes all is tragic, but we are made to see into her mental growth, where she fights out of her naiveté, into a woman who finally finds her own voice – as an individual in her own right. The film also makes excellent use of the minor characters, how each build and adds to the atmosphere, to give a sense that there is a darker and massive backdrop against which the characters interplay their lives. Vishal Bhardwaj makes this an important locus in the film – the voices of the minor characters help the audience visualize, like a synecdoche, in quick snippets, of the freedom struggle, the INA, Subhas Bose, Hitler, Churchill and the whole vicious panorama of war. The characters of Zulfi, Julia's troupe, the war nurse, the Indian rajah all command significant screen time to build the context. The other important aspect of the film was to showcase the little known area of Arunachal Pradesh with its wild beauty. All the three main actors, Kangana, Shahid and Saif provide matured and stellar performances. But the scene steal-er was the evil British Major General, like Major Hans Landa – a suitable and stock villain, refusing to die. A film that is full on entertainment and with the right amount of drama. Not to be missed.",9
662,A Great 'Vishaal Bhardwaaj' film with a disappointing 'David Dhawan' film ending,"If I am going to watch a 'first day first show' of Rangoon, there is no need to say that I am a big Vishaal Bhardwaj fan. I started waiting for the release date since I came to know that 'Rangoon' was being directed by Mr. Bhardwaj. From very first scene to 5 minutes before the end, film is so good that you really have to appreciate the story, direction, music, acting and all. But if you talk about climax, it is so disappointing that you can't believe it is the same film. I mean, how would you feel if after having a perfect cup of Coffee in the evening, you are suddenly forced to taste the 'plum sauce'? Or, while watching a whole 'Bhardwaj' movie, you are forced to watch the climax of a typical 'David Dhawan' or 'Anees Bazmee' film? It doesn't mean that I don't like the movies of these two film directors, or I don't like 'plum sauce' at all. But is there any combination? I mean, seriously? Besides the disappointing ending, overall it is one of the best Vishaal Bhardwaj movies. It makes you feel as good as watching 'Omkara', 'Ishqiya' or 'Haider'. Cast is good. Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor are great in their roles. Kangana is the pure 'soul' of the film. She has acted really good and has looked really pretty in the film. Music is fine. Dance performances, war scenes are also great. But, if you don't want to feel as bad as I am, it is recommended to leave the hall 5 minutes prior to the ending.",8
663,Another Example of Classy Film Making but There is something less in it at the End.,"RANGOON REVIEW : From the beginning to the End it is a Complete Vishal Bhardwaj Film. You know what i mean if you have seen Highly Critical acclaimed films of Vishal Bhardwaj, he does not make films for entertainment or Commercial success, he makes films only for Quality Cinema Lovers. And Rangoon is another feather in his Cap. Starcast is Brilliant, and Top 3 Leading Actors have done a Brilliant Job. Saif is Rough and Royal, Kangana looks damn beautiful and presents another Outstanding performance for which i except some Nominations for her if not Awards, Shahid Kapoor is Excellent in his Role especially in 2nd half. Film is set in 40's so Locations are really very good and a suitable Cinematography makes it eye pleasing. Writing is Perhaps the best part of film as it is set in 40's and as shown in Trailer and film's poster it has all the engaging elements like Love, War and Deceit. Screenplay is Good, engaged, never makes you feel bore but still looks stretched due to less Comedy and entertainment factor. Editing could have been better but i'm confused which scenes deserves cuts because i never felt bored while watching film. Music is Surprisingly Good, reason is, there is Not a single Chartbuster or not even a Hit song in film and i felt bored when i watched video songs promos and listen mp3 but in a Film all songs are situational, meaningful so does gripped. Dialogues are Hilarious at some stages, meaningful and classy in some scenes. Approx 10%Dialogues are in English which only Highly Educated Saifians can understand, not for Masala Film lovers. Direction is Top Class, i mean if you notice carefully then almost every frame of film gives hints of Classy Film Making. Climax was Patriotic and suitable but Shahid and Kangana's death scenes looks animated and childish. A better climax would have made this film a Classic like previous films of Bhardwaj but Rangoon clearly fell short to that Tag. Overall it is a Very Good Film but i recommend this film to only and only Classes Audience. It is not a Massy film so masses should stay away from it, it is not a Family Entertainer so Family audience should not even think to watch it. If you loved Classics like Omkara and Haider then you will definitely like Rangoon but just don't expect a same kind of Quality cause Rangoon has its own Magic. I'm going with 7/10 stars, giving it a Verdict that It is a Film that keeps you hooked from the beginning till the End, looks like another Classic from Bhardwaj but slightly disappoints you in Climax.",7
664,Kangana just outshined the actors and Vishal's weak screenplay,"Its just unbelievable how brilliant this girl is. She doesn't just utter dialogues, she imbibes the soul of the character. It seems like she gets posessed, every part of her body acts. Ranging from voice modulation, eye movements, walking, hand gestures, body language and twitching of face muscles. As an artist She is a gift to Indian cinema.",10
665,nice movie but could be better,"i am a fan of the actress of this movie who is the only lady who can challenge khans. definitely it is a far far better movie than raees. she again proved about her versatility of acting.she performed comedy, romantic,emotional, fighting, dance all and supposed to be won a award. the movie is a story of love triangle in a patriotic base. the dialogue ,""what is more valuable than your own life"" and the answer really warm up your blood.it gives a hint of struggle of netaji for azad hind fuzz. draw backs: the movies is so lengthy; 167 min which could be shortened. many scenes not linked with script could be cut. script is weak many places. there is a break of flow of movies. director tries to do his best with a weak script. climax is good, but could be better.... but if you can watch a filmy presentation of a crime petrol story in raees than definitely it is a better movie, just watch.",10
666,Love story set in the time of world war II.,"World War II has never topped the long list of stories that the writers and directors in Bollywood have covered. Rangoon, for a change, and a good one at that, is set in the time of the war. For the first time, we get a glimpse of India during the world war II. How India survived and dealt with the war while fighting for its own independence tooth and nail? You get an idea about it through the movie.It's not only about the soldiers fighting in the uniform, it's also about soldiers fighting without ever donning a uniform. How Azad Hind Fauz, gave a tough time to the Britishers during the time is beautifully depicted in the movie and yet, it is not the typical movie about the wars and battles. It's a Love Story.This Vishal Bharadwaj movie pleases you, entertains you, and touches you in a manner that isn't as simple to decipher and understand as it seems to be. And why it should be? After all, it's a Vishal Bharadwaj movie. The movie flows like poetry. Music is very different from the typical Arijit Singh music that we have, in the last couple of years, become so used to listening. Intense performances from all the three leads; no one less than the other, each challenging the other while at the same time, complementing the other. 10 on 10. Go watch. Period.",10
667,Good movie but little stretchy,"Rangoon - Nice movie. Movie revolves around the pre Independence era and the rise of patriotism among the so called Indians who thought British rule was better than the power going in to the hands of their fellow Indians. In the middle of all this - a Passionate triangle love story. Story has a touch of Vishal's uniqueness, dialogues looks good with some famous Shairis included in it and songs are not so melodious however sounds good as have different kind of lyrics which resembles Vishal Bhardwaj type of movies. All actors have done a beautiful job. Shahid has really grown as an actor with some great movies in his bucket though the film doesn't allows him show his full potential as screen is shared by two other established actors. Kangana has a very good screen share and she used it wisely with her performance and beauty. Saif's acting has nothing new to offer. Supporting actors​ are good. First half of the movie is little slow paced but gradually picks up. Second half is decent. Overall its a good watch",8
668,Predictable!!,"This movie has great production budget and even a better screenplay. But, the premise is unrealistic (or) one cannot really comprehend to - a drama troop goes to Rangoon to entertain the battalion during WWII... Seriously?! Had it been made as a war time movie without this love trope, it would still be a classic spy thriller. The biggest drawback is you don't relate to the characters inspite of terrific musical score from Vishal Bhardwaj.",8
669,A Movie that Bollywood never made before.,"Rangoon is a movie that reminds you why you love movies. It has Love, Hate, War, Drama, Emotions, Action, Deceit, Music, Patriotism, Entertainment. Overall Rangoon is a complete package. It has some never seen before scenes and location. Filled with some great performances by Shahid Saif and Kangana. Rangoon will make you emotional it'll give you goosebumps and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch it for the great cinematic experience. Shahid-Vishal combo never disappoints.",9
670,Contrary to Public reviews and critic's reviews,"This film is very well made . Stellar performances from Shahid Kapur , Kangna and Saif .The film is visually stunning and keeps you curious and intrigued. The climax is slightly funny unintentionally because of bad CGI",9
671,Amazing Movie Must Watch!!,This is a beautiful movie. Very well done and superb acting by Shahid Kapoor and Kangana. Great Story ..Just watch it. India needs to make more of these types of movies.I loved it. Its very entertaining.Kangana should get an award for her performance.,10
672,A love triangle with a side missing in this Vishal Bhardwaj film.,"From Omkara until Haider, I've always admired Vishal Bhardwaj's work based on his writing, direction, acting, and music. I was pretty eager for this film based on the good trailer despite the negativity it received on Youtube but the songs on the other hand made me skeptical about it. But after watching this, I felt that that something went wrong in terms of storytelling and visuals in some way.So this movie focuses on an actress named Julia who dates a Parsi filmmaker and millionaire Rustom Billimoria who is already married but tries to hide this relationship from his wife. But due to some circumstances, Julia falls in love with an Indian soldier named Nawab Malik who is currently fighting at the Burmese Border along with the British and Japanese army. The love triangle between the actress, soldier, and the filmmaker is basically what this movie is about.Quite frankly, this film is a bore to many extents. The way the movie started was good and unapologetic making me realize that this film is going somewhere but post interval becomes too far-fest and uneven creepiness starts to crawl in especially with a generic ending which didn't do any justice to the movie.War genre-based films follow a certain pattern by its set design, costumes, weaponry,and VFX. The film managed to tackle some of these elements but the VFX wasn't crisp enough. Vishal's previous film Haider had all these elements. I believe he should continue making Shakespeare play based films because of the amount of success he retained from these films.The music was below average especially taking 75% of the film for these songs. What I mean generally is that there were more than 10 songs in that movie and that is how it took so much time of the movie. The lyrics were written like some 5 year old was singing a lullaby. Even with VB composing, he also lost the touch in music.Despite the criticism, there are some saving grace moments in this film.The acting was amazing. Shahid Kapoor gives a flawless performance and he started really well in this film. Just stay away from R.Rajkumar and Shandaar's zone please. Even surprisingly, Saif Ali Khan was also good in his part. Kanagana Ranaut's mentality from Queen raised her performance in this movie a notch from the top. But the British Dude was so irritating in this film especially the way he spoke Hindi. The cinematography and direction was nice especially the way the film was shot. Every frame was executed beautifully and the war scenes were also shot good but like I said, the VFX and editing needed more work.Overall, this movie is undoubtedly one of the most disappointing films of 2017 and yeah based on the good performances, I would rate it a one-time watch but in my opinion, this VB film is worth watching on a T.V broadcast or on a Netflix.Vishal Bhardwaj, I would bid this masterpiece for a dollar but not more than that.2/5",6
673,Weakest film of Vishal Bhardwaj till now. Completely disappointing,"There comes a time when as a audience you are eagerly waiting for a film with supremely talented actors, finest director and breath- taking visuals. Will Rangoon live up to its name ? Lets find out ..Set in the Pre-Independence era during the British rule, ""Rangoon"" is a love triangle between Kangana Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapur. Kangana plays as actress, Jaanbaaz Julie, and looks absolutely gorgeous in her new avatar. While Saif plays the role of a director, Shahid gets his down dirty essaying a soldier in the film.When you know that film is being directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the curiosity will reach sky high as the marvelous director has given us ""Makdee"", ""Omkara"", ""Haider"", ""Maqbool"" and ""The Blue Umbrella"" to name a few. However, my joy turned out sour after watching ""Rangoon"" today. The movie does not give out the cinematic brilliance as showed by Bhardwaj in his previous films. The movie begins with a guerrilla war scene which has been well executed followed by introduction of each characters. The movie does not keeps you engaged and inclusion of unnecessary songs just adds further woes.The second half does not seem to take off and even the main story unfolding here does not help much. Climax is weakly depicted and has nothing to talk about.Vishal Bhardwaj seems to have missed the bus this time as ""Rangoon"" falls flat on the face. Script is a mess with no clue about what is the actual story. Cinematography is amazing along with tuneful songs (though too many). Art direction is good but editing is bad. Performances wise, none of the actors were impressive. Kangana Ranaut went over board while Saif Ali Khan had nothing much to do. It was Shahid Kapur who showed some decent performance.Overall, probably the most weakest film of Vishal Bhardwaj till now. Poor 1/5",1
674,A love story with breaks,"Wish characters could write their own ends. Wish the actors playing them could rescue them from this helplessness. A fiery little 'banjaaran' is bought off a street performance by a visionary businessman. He then tames this 'wildness' into a feisty and fashionable Miss Julia. But for obvious reasons, he is unable to tame her heart, which is still lost in the wilderness it had come from. Rangoon the movie, promises from the very beginning, to be made to appreciate Kangana, the 'queen'. It is she, in a welcome change, who gets a royal 'introduction' into the story and she accepts it with aplomb. Because here is a performance which overshadows everything, the other performances, the confusing storyline, the gigantic sets, the excellent cinematography and of course, the soulful music. Because, when Miss Julia enters, you look at only her and when she exits, you wait, only for her. Cheers to both the male leads, a painfully restrained Shahid Kapoor and an equally, if not more controlled Saif Ali Khan, who gracefully accept the reign of the 'queen' over the entire film. The brilliant actors that they are, they have shown bravery in accepting itself, the roles of characters who are nothing but providers of plot points to a scattered story to which the heroine acts and reacts. So it is a welcome change indeed to see the heroine ride into the den of enemies and save her prince charming, the heroine to make the first move in her own love story and the heroine again to playfully defeat an exceptional soldier in swording. If only the climax too could keep the queen's flag flying high. Good songs, poetic visuals and excellent dialogues. We only wish the script had focused on one story in completion instead of getting scattered into so many snippets of different ideologies. Rangoon should be watched, for all these positives and of course, for the queen on screen, Kangana Ranaut.",7
675,Nothing new except the premise and look,"Score 3 / 10 Major problem of this film is Director's Mr. Vishal Bhardwaj's especial craving for dark comedy. It hampers two major emotions of this film that is love and thrill. Either it tenderness or wilderness, he could visualize black comedy in it. Screenplay is below average. Characterization is bad. This film is a old love triangle rather than action drama but screenplay writers are so creatively empty that when love has to be established, they come with only lip lock, that is so many. This is there take of love. This love track is typical, like a person is appointed to guard her, then some mishap and they are lost in jungle, some armed personal attack with comical angle like force to dance then rescue, hostage and finally rain and others lame incidents including sudden kissing. This shatters lead girl character because lip lock was forced. Only removing leech from her entire body by male was enough for her to fall for him when she was established madly in love with another man. That person ditches her to go alone to Burma makes his character grey too. British general speaks good Hindi, even rare Urdu words like Unvan, rehearse Gazhal singing but his pronunciations clearly reflect that he is faking of his Hindi or Urdu knowledge. Few dialogues are very good but rest are just OK. First half is wasted in the name of love track, second half should have been patriotic but mostly revolves around love triangle. There are lot of drama too but you feel nothing. Climax is so lengthy, boring and somehow childish. Especially the bridge sequence after blast. In interval, body guard belongs to same army but it seems that girl is going towards some rival army. It was just so it could look like interval. Performance wise everyone is average except the Major General Harding David played by Richard McCabe. His expressions are fantastic and very swift.",3
676,Beautiful movie with disappointing ending,"The movie is good if you forgive the cliché ending. The performances of Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan is mind-blowing. Kangana Ranaut steals the show. Indeed, she is the 'Hero' of the movie. The cinematography is good. The film shows the INA version of anthem which is worth mentioning. Except for the climax, the movie is worth watching.",7
677,"Masterpiece Actors, but not the movie!","When you see such an ensemble, you ought to expect a lot from the movie. And when it's Vishal Bhardwaj's directorial, it seems to be a cherry on the cake. But here, the cake is not so delicious. After a slow first half, the movie progresses well in the second half but fails to impress. Bhardwaj's ambitious concoct of a love story against the backdrop of second world war seems loose. The story lacks crispness and does not look intense. Coming to performances, Kangana is the hero of the movie. she effortlessly portrays her character of Julia, who is stuck between love and obligation. Her transition from a naive and beautiful girl to a strong and bold lady scintillates through her eyes. ""Bloody hell"".Shahid is one fine actor who has been constantly diversifying his roles. And Vishal Bhardwaj always brings best out of him. He is terrific in this one too and let's his eyes do the talking.Saif, with reminiscence of Langda Tyagi, gives one fine performance. His portrayal of an obsessive lover, who thinks that Julia is his to posses, brings a lot of conviction. The last scene is way too dramatic, cinematography is good but unrealistic at times. Had the story been more crisp, it would have been a treat to watch these actors sharing the stage; but sadly it is not.",6
678,Good and the bad,"Firstly the good about the movie
Amazing cinematography
Wonderful direction
Excellent acting by the lead and the ensemble castThe badThe villain's attempt at reciting Urdu poetry and singing song which was forced upon. He should have just recited the lines carefully but his English was pretty good so he should have stuck to that.
A sword was able to buy the independence of india? The relevance of that is absent in historic books.
The ending could have been way better
The title of the movie does not justify the storyline",8
679,Entertaining.,"What more could you ask for, it was jolly entertaining. It almost did not feel like a Indian film really, except for the musical interludes. Well worth a viewing, kept me sofa bound for the length of the film. Some of these Indian films deserve to be more well known outside of Asia.",8
680,Loved - loved - LOVED this movie!,"Cinderella is a timeless classic, a fairytale for all ages. And ""Ever After"" is pitch-perfect as an adaptation of the Cinderella story to screen.As a fairytale, this movie follows a predictable pattern and storyline. It is sweet, light, innocent and beautiful. Stunningly beautiful. The cinematography is one of the stars here and this is a fabulous movie to watch - for the scenery, the costumes and the visual effects.Anjelica Huston steals the show as the evil stepmother, but Drew Barrymore puts in a fine performance here, and Patrick Godfrey is wonderfully eccentric as Leonardo Da Vinci. Overall, this is not so much a movie about the acting, but it's more about the sometimes sappy, usually saccharine, but wonderfully heartfelt classic story. Instead of the magic of the original fairytale, Ever After replaces it with the ""magic"" of wit, humour and heart. And there's nothing wrong with that.Funny and charming, Ever After is one of those great movies that can be watched over and over again.",9
681,...and they lived happily ever after; but what happened before that?,"I remember when this movie was released, I saw it so many times in the theater with my friends. We were 13, perfect age group for the film and we adored everything about this movie. It's years later and I bought the movie on DVD making me wonder if the movie did hold up as well as I remembered. Well, it doesn't hold the same magic as I saw when I was a kid, but Ever After still holds a certain charm that is absolutely irresistible. I think between the writing and the characters, this was a great update on a classic story. Every little girl has dreamed of being Cinderella, the girl who has been dumped on her whole life and then the man of your dreams comes to save you as you live happily ever after. Drew Barrymore takes lead through this charming fairy tale of a strong woman with the good faith that one day things will go as they should and she'd live in a utopia.Danielle de Barbarac is a young girl who lives in a manor with her widowed father whom she adores. When Danielle is eight, her father marries the haughty Baroness Rodmilla de Ghent, who has two daughters about Danielle's age. Soon after, Auguste dies. Rodmilla is envious of Danielle, and treats her like a servant after Auguste's death. The Baroness has fallen into debt. Marguerite, her spoiled older daughter, has grown to be cruel, arrogant, and bad-tempered; while the younger, Jacqueline, is kindhearted, soft-spoken, and constantly overlooked. In the orchard one day, Danielle encounters a man attempting to steal her father's old horse. She pelts him with apples, knocking him to the ground, and is horrified to learn that the man is Henry, the Prince of France. Henry explains that his own horse was lamed in his attempt to escape stifling royal life. He forgives Danielle in exchange for her silence, and rewards her with money. Danielle resolves to use the money to rescue Maurice, an old family servant whom Rodmilla had sold. While her step-family is out of the house, Danielle dons a noblewoman's dress and goes to court. She finds Maurice about to be shipped to the Americas, and demands his release. Prince Henry sees this and is impressed with Danielle's intellect, strength of character, and beauty. Danielle refuses to tell Henry her name, though eventually she leaves him with the name of her mother, Comtesse Nicole de Lancret. Leading him to want to speak with her more only to fall in love with her not knowing that she is a true Cinderella.I still like this movie very much. Drew and the other actors may not have a great accent but they still all tried their best. Angelica Huston, what a great choice as the wicked step mother and I use that term lightly. There is this beautiful scene between her and Danielle, she starts to tell Danielle about her father and how Angelica barely knew him, you see a sense of humanity in her and then she starts to look at Danielle with love but realizes how hurt she still is that her father cared more for Danielle than his own wife. You understand how she could be angry and jealous, not justifying what she did to Danielle, but her motivation is understandable and I love the punishment she receives for what she did. There's still a scene that gets a great reaction from me, when Marguerite just spitefully tells Danielle how her mother is dead and Danielle just goes up to her and gives her one hell of a punch, I think that's when I fell in love with her! What strength was given to the character making the film more than just a ""happily ever after"" film, but a wonderful fairy tale with enjoyable characters, a wonderful romance, humor and most of all leaves you with a smile on your face.8/10",8
682,Good,Easily in the top 3 or 4 hundred Cinderella remakes of all time.,10
683,Delightful retelling of a classic fairytale!,"This movie is beautiful, and I am not just saying that. The cinematography and costumes(especially Danielle's swan dress) was gorgeous, especially in the ballroom scene. I loved the fact that they made it 16th century, that was really clever. The music was so beautiful, that at times I was reduced to tears. Now for the characters. Drew Barrymore, with an excellent English accent, has never been more beautiful as feisty servant Danielle, and the twists Andy Tennant put in allowed the romance of her and Dougray Scott(also excellent) to shine even brighter. Angelica Huston was deliciously evil as Rodmilla the evil stepmother, and Patrick Godfrey was surprisingly good as Leonardo Da Vinci. The stepsisters were also a delight to watch. The witty dialogue had some truly funny bits, like the scene in the woods, and some tearjerkers, the death of Danielle's father. The introduction of the Grimm Brothers was also great. All in all, I highly recommend this movie to all those who love romance. 10/10. Bethany Cox",10
684,"The ""real story"" that Cinderella was based on","""Ever After: A Cinderella Story"" (1998) stars Drew Barrymore as Danielle, the daughter of a wealthy commoner in 16th century France. When her father unexpectedly dies, Danielle becomes the servant girl of her arrogant stepmother (Angelica Huston). When she runs into the prince of the kingdom (Dougray Scott), he becomes captivated by her honesty, humility, wisdom and beauty. Meanwhile, her stepmother schemes to have her shallow daughter (Megan Dodds) marry the prince. Melanie Lynskey plays the younger stepsister while Patrick Godfrey plays Leonardo Da Vinci and Lee Ingleby plays Danielle's guy-friend from her youth.This is a quality costume dramedy/romance. Shot entirely in France at no less than four châteaus (castles), as well as some sweet wilderness areas, the film is awe-inspiring just to look at. The story is a little convoluted, so you have to pay attention to keep track of what's going on. Drew shines as the protagonist and Scott is great as the prince. The movie proves that you don't have to have overt sex scenes and nudity for a film like this to be effective or successful (which it was at the box office). I also like the message concerning the idiocy of societal classes and how one of the stepsisters is actually a quality soul.The film runs 121 minutes.GRADE: B+",7
685,PERFECT!!!!!,"This movie is pure magic. Positively perfect in every way shape or form. If you haven't seen it, please do. It is an old story with several new twists. But it doesn't matter. The characters are perfect. The direction is perfect. It's worth it's weight, and then some, in gold. Watch it with the family and learn the meaning of sacrifice. And yes, I hate to admit it but true love.",10
686,Best Ever!,To me this was the best remake of a fairytale ever! And I don't care if it's because I'm a girl and this is girlie material- I still loved it! Drew Barrymore personified this interpretation of Cinderella like no other. Angelica Houston was a kick ass evil stepmother. The combination of these two dynamite stars in these two classic roles created an unequaled magic. And of course let's not forget the freakishly handsome Dougray Scott who played Prince Henry. He graced the screen with a hypnotic charm that challenges any prince any day. This is my all time favourite movie. I can watch it over and over again. And I challenge any man to watch this film and understand what romance is really all about.,10
687,Kick-Ass Cinderella,"Cinderella kicks butt in this feminist retelling of the classic fairy tale. Orphaned as a young girl, Danielle (Cinderella) is raised by her evil stepmother and two stepsisters in rural 16th century France. After a few chance encounters with the crown prince (who falls in love with her), Danielle finds herself on a collision course with her family who have royal designs of their own. Shot on location in France, the dialogue often veers very close to preachy, but knows when to cut the politics and return to the story. And a good story it is, well acted by Drew Barrymore as Danielle, and Angelica Huston as the wicked stepmother. This one is worth the rental.",7
688,Could not stop watching,"I missed this when it came out, probably due to the negative reviews. Wow, is this film so good! Humor, romance, intelligence, action, etc. are all there and en pointe.",10
689,Really enjoyed this -even 20 years later!,"Well-written, well-acted. Beautiful location/ scenery. Musical score is outstanding - perfect period/era fit & exquisite performances. A worthwhile and entertaining movie. Drew B, Angelica H. and cast including some soon-to-be-famous colleagues never seem trite or campy, but very authentic. Comic moments & surprising twists on the traditional Cinderella story make this a gem.",9
690,Beautiful Love Story,"""Ever After"" is a wonderfully imaginative romance. It's a classic Cinderella tale set in 16th-century France and revolves around an independent young woman named Danielle. Although she works as a servant for her stepmother, Danielle is anything but weak and subservient. She is passionate and strong-willed, qualities that lead her to the French court dressed as a wealthy courtier to save a man's life. There she meets the handsome Prince Henry, who is jaded by his suffocating royal lifestyle. He is fascinated by Danielle and her thirst for life and adventure, and they fall deeply in love - but her jealous stepmother will do anything to keep them apart.Drew Barrymore turns in a stunning performance as Danielle. Her emotions are raw and realistic and she gives the character charm, wit, and beauty.Anjelica Huston brings a third dimension to her role as the ""evil"" stepmother, who is usually just portrayed as a flat character. In this movie she is an ambitious mother who would do anything to make her own daughter a queen.The Prince is also usually a pretty flat, cliché character, but Dougray Scott brought a refreshingly human side to him and portrayed his struggles and conflicts very well.The script is strong for a romantic fairy tale and the cinematography is gorgeous. There is one scene in which Danielle is floating on her back in the river, a dreamy and breathtaking moment that describes her carefree nature perfectly. The music composed by George Fenton is lovely - I recommend the soundtrack for this movie too, especially ""Walking On Water.""A wonderful movie for all lovers of romance! 10/10",10
691,"Interesting re-imagined version of Cinderella, with good acting and reasonable writing","As this came on TV, I decided to grant it a chance, in spite of not being a great fan of fairy tales. I found it quite entertaining, even if there are maybe a few lapses in writing. The plot is quite good, and progresses nicely throughout. The pacing is fair. The dialog is well-written and equally delivered. The acting is all pretty good... it was a pleasant surprise to see Melanie Lynskey(whom I so far have only seen one other place... as Rose on Two and a Half Men, a role that doesn't require all that much talent) play a much more grounded character, and do so very well. Dougray Scott was good. Anjelica Huston portrayed the evil stepmother of the story really good. Barrymore was well-chosen for the tom-boyish lead who is not stripped of feminine traits. The humor is decent... personally, I didn't laugh much, though several of Drew's character's actions had me cheering for her. The cinematography and editing was quite good throughout. The prelude and prologue are both well-written and fit in well with the tone and direction of the film. The mood isn't too sweet and while this is a fairy tale, it still managed to entertain me(and I have never found works in that genre to be of any interest to me). The only thing I truly didn't like about this was the line near the beginning which tried to place one definite meaning upon the smile of the Mona Lisa. I refer to the marvelously talented director Stanley Kubrick, who quite eloquently and perfectly expressed why such a thing should never be done. I recommend this to fans of fairy tales and/or the actors involved. 7/10",7
692,Smart and Moving Cinderella Retelling,"Cinderella has been a story that's been told and re-told a million times over by this point with every storyteller struggling to put their own unique stamp on it to make it worthy of being re-told in the first place. Many of these have worked well and become favorites for generations of children and their families, but few have been as smart, down to earth and nuanced as Ever After. It's a film that deletes any mention of magic or fairy godmothers and has its heroine attend the big royal ball due to her own smarts and a little help from the people she's supported over the years.Drew Barrymore plays Danielle, a young woman who's been cast aside by her stepfamily and made to work as a servant in their home ever since her father died. Her stepmother, Rodmilla (Anjelica Houston), is obsessed with upper mobility and wants her beautiful daughter Margueritte to nab a prince. What she doesn't expect is for Danielle to happen upon this prince one day and strike up a relationship with him all the while pretending to be her dead mother. As they grow closer, Danielle must figure out if she has the courage to reveal her true self to the prince, free herself from the shackles of her stepfamily, and live happily ever after.Even the stepfamily, while still wicked, are given much more dimension here and more realistic motivations. Rodmilla is motivated by her own self-preservation and not by just being evil for evil's sake. Houston is especially good in a scene where she allows herself to show a little vulnerability to Danielle and we see that her life didn't turn out the way she'd planned.",9
693,My favorite movie of all time.,"MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.comREVIEW: 
NOTE: I have watched this movie a lot. I can't even count how many times.I really love this movie. This is the best adaptation of Cinderella for me (it's even better than the original one for me). I love how to story panned out. It's more realistic and there was a relationship even before the ball. Plus, there was justice in the end.Danielle is an amazing character. She's not passive like the typical Cinderella. You would really cheer for her throughout the movie. I love that she played by Drew Barrymore. Also, I really like the historical setting of the movie. It gave the movie a much more realistic tone. SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Yes!! Absolutely!!",10
694,Preferred rendition of the Cinderella Story.,"Regardless of how closely this follows the original telling, this is a lovely, endearing, and compelling tale, told as the ""real"" story of Cinderella. It does not matter whose version was original, from which country it was told, or who the players were (Prince Henry of France in fact married Catherine de Medici, a member of the Italian nobility, not Drew Barrymore's character.), this movie is pure magic.In this reviewer's opinion, this is the very best of Drew Barrymore's work. This is her greatest role, her greatest portrayal, her best movie. Period. For that fact alone, you should see this attempt, but let me continue.The acting is spot on, the sets and costumes were meticulously designed, the writing involved here was flawless, the directing was pure professionalism, the flow was smooth, the tale was the best-told tale I've seen in years, and the finished product was a masterpiece.I was, and am, enchanted by this film, in every way. This is the ""adult version"" of this work, but I also still admire (greatly) the Disney collector's edition gift set of Cinderella.It rates a 9.7/10 from...the Fiend :.",10
695,A wonderfully surprising movie that was both charming and heart-wrenching.,"When my sister-in-law suggested we rent & watch this movie, I admit that I didn't want to see it. And even though I noticed plastic cups on the table and bad English accents in what was supposed to be set in France, I TOTALLY enjoyed this movie. It is true that making it more into a real story w/out a magical fairy godmother, but instead an intelligent DaVinci, just added more substance to the story itself. The character of Danielle (Cinderella) was even more engrossing than the original tale. Instead of being this inexplicable, wonderful, saintly human being, she is a all too human and someone that's easier to relate to. This is a movie for all ages. Even my husband really liked it and he's an action movie fan. The costumes were beautiful and the music was enchanting. People can find fault with anything, but sometimes it's better to enjoy something for what it is... a good story.",8
696,Excellent adaptation of the fairy tale,"Having been watching quite a few versions of the Cinderella fairy tale, I'm glad I watched this one last, 19 years later today in 2017, November 21st. At first I thought to myself this is gonna be the same experience, which was always a good watch with every other Cinderella adaptation by the way, but I was wrong. This version is very refreshing, while still true to the core elements of the original story, it is done differently, which is quite surprising and give different enjoyment throughout the duration of the movie.Drew Barrymore's performance is very captivating, she portrays Cinderella very beautifully.",10
697,Truly Enchanting,"I loved this movie when I was 15 and equally love it now that I am close to 27. This movie is refreshing compared to the romantic comedies we are bombarded with today. For today romance of this kind is branded to be 'unrealistic' which makes me love this movie even more. She never slept with him before she married him, never had an ex, didn't turn into a drunk or drug addict, never had to talk incessantly about her career, no ridiculous night club scenes, relied more on her intelligence and wit then her looks and what was wonderfully refreshing was prince charming was exactly the same. They really don't portray couples like this anymore. Which makes us think they don't exist........but they do.. bravo for Ever After!",10
698,"After 46 years from ""Papaflessas""","Four years of research, study and work ... two different cities (Giannitsa and Thessaloniki) and a lot of love for Greek history needed to shoot the new film about the revolution of 1821. After 46 years from ""Papaflessas"" while we are approaching 200 years since the palligennesia our nation.The film ""Exodus 1826"" describes the story of 120 men from Samarina, Grevena and the surrounding villages, who rushed to help in the Mesolongi Exit in April 1826.It is an independent production. The direction and the script are by Vasilis TsikarasIt all started about 4 years ago when the director, Vasilis Tsikiras, reading about the revolution of 1821, was particularly moved by the story of ... the children of Samarina, and he wanted to understand the verse of the folk song ""Children of Samarina"".",10
699,A great effort of modern Greek Cinema!,"The Greek Independence War against the Ottoman Turkish Empire, is an AMAZING & IMPORTANT historical event that VERY FEW films hove covered - one or two Hollywood films and a couple dozen ""Kitsch"" Greek movies...This is the 1st film of this group/production.Their 2nd is ""Siege"" (2019). I wrote a large review for that 2nd film, go ahead and read it - its EXACTLY the same like this here, a GOOD effort with an average result.",6
700,Better than any 70's Greek Revolution drama,"There is no denying that this film has some obvious shortcomings. It moves slowly, it has rather weak dialogue and some of its parts lack authenticity.
However, it triumphs in an area where almost every other Greek patriotic film has failed and that is the detailed depiction of the inner conflict between the protagonists' personal feelings and their commitment to the national cause. In films like ""Papaflessas"" or ""Souliotes"" we see the heroes talk of self-sacrifice so many times and so pompously that everything looks unreal and unconvincing. Here we are faced with the human emotion as it really is. These men know they are going to lose their lives, but they decide to go and fight. They know what they leave behind, but they are determined to aid their compatriots and they march on. They are plagued by feelings of doom, but they still continue with their perilous journey. This inner conflict is depicted masterfully in the gloomy faces of the heroes, their stoic silences, their raw reactions, their melancholic movements.In short, ""Exodos 1826"" is a decent project and a fresh approach to the Greek patriotic film genre. It is not perfect, but it is undoubtedly a step forward.",6
701,Brilliant!,"The movie narrates the true (unknown) story of those men that left their homes in Greek village of Samarina to assist the besieged city of Messolongi during the Greek revolutionary war in 1826. Excellent acting, music, photography and a script that unfolds in a very dramatic way. A great movie",10
702,Terrific cinematography ...only that !,"You wait for something better when the last Greek film about the revolution 1821
was in 70's.Excluding the great landscapes and the terrific cinematography,the
acting was very poor and the direction doesn't have the real feeling. I was waiting for a climax that never came , too pity !",4
703,AMAZING!!!,"Such a brilliant film for its very low budget! 
Exodos 1826 is a emotional film that shows how brave the men back then were, not only they marched to help their compatriots with risk of being spotted and killed on their way from the Turkish/albanian troops, but also they knew that the Battle of Mesolongi was very difficult and of doubtful outcome!Worthy sons of their Hellenic name and origin!Bravo, we need more films like those",10
704,Bad,"The good : B. Tsikaras makes a movie with no budget and resources but he organizes a team of many people successfully and I respect that. Also the direction of photography is amazing, D. stampolis delivered a visually interesting story.
The bad : everything else. The script, acting, directing, action.",2
705,Three are talking and two are dancing....,"Α tasteless, badly made movie, without direction, script and performances. A total...""disaster"" or just another failed pseudo historical movie that wished to be ""epic""...A waste of time and resources, even if those were obviously restricted and insufficient. Probably, the worst movie of this category made in recent years, it can be paralleled with the equally ridiculous ""Fetih 1453"" of 2012.",1
706,A Very Long March...with soporific tendencies...,"I have just spent 1hr and 15 mins of a 1hr.36min film... watching a group of men walking through beautiful Greek mountains and countryside. There were occasional stops for some rather stilted dialogue. The womenfolk spent about maybe 15 mins in the whole film bemoaning their men's absence...
This is supposed to be a movie about a heroic group of Greeks marching to help Missolonghi fight the Turks. It could have been 'epic'... Instead, it turned into an 'epic' ...fight to stay awake. Walking, stopping, more walking. Night movement where the Greeks, in blazing white costumes...tried to remain unnoticed.
To say I was both disappointed and unimpressed would probably sum it up. Greeks can occasionally make really good TV and cinema, crisis or no crisis. Loufa kai Paralagi, the TV series is a hoot, really funny, and stands repeated watching. The first movie spin off (not the movie original) Seirines sto Aigeo, was also funny. Then Serines sti Steria less so, and after that descent followed rapidly.
This 'Exodos 26' is a case where promising material, a good story, could have been made really exciting and inspiring... but instead fell flatter than a pancake. I'd rather watch To Nisi TBH. Greeks could do with some really good cinematic/TV historical uplift. This is not it.
Sadly, Greece has a tendency to produce boring, stupid, or crazy ('Weird Wave') cinema/TV. Another rare exception to this was Aggigma Psyhis. But the exceptions are so few and far between, I spend ages on the Greek Movies website trying to find exceptions, and largely failing. L&P is there, AP is there. So is this.
It doesn't require an enormous budget to make a decent production. Just good actors, good script, and imaginative direction. Sadly, Greece, at present, while it might have the first, is sadly lacking in the other two. And I'm not the first to say this. Many of the fiercest critics of Greek TV/film are Greeks themselves.",2
707,Not a real production,"This is not a licensed, commercially available film.It's video (via YouTube) of production backstage and clips from the show.",1
708,Horrible,"This was the first play I ever walked out on. I did wait until the intermission but only out of respect to the other audience members and the cast. My only advice is, don't bring anyone to this for their first play as they may never go to another play again.",1
709,A feminine look on the effects of wars in a historical fantasy.,"This film is a victim of a racist and smear campaign. The smear campaign was so successful that two mayors put a ban on this film! As for the film, I can say that as a comedy film it serves its genre quite well. The cast is great. The setting is unbelievably stunning. The music is great for Turkish music lovers. The script is quite balanced and hilarious at times. The acting is superb. There are some flaws in the script and the rhythm of the film but overall it was quite entertaining and satisfactory. I would give a well-deserved 7 over 10 to this film of Mahzun Kırmızıgül. The 3.7 given by the voters on IMDb is totally biased and unfair.",7
710,What a disappointment!,"As a Turkish viewer who enjoyed most of Mahsun's movies, I must admit that this one fell short of my expectations. Basically intended to be a satirical comedy, this movie is actually lacking both character development and relevancy to the genre.
As Turkish audience, we have seen good examples of satirical comedy reflecting the Ottoman Period such as Sener Sen's Degirmen. But unfortunately the quality there is incomparable to this one. Besides I have seen some reviews here claiming that those who rate this movie low are doing it because Mahsun is opposed to the government and values in Turkey. I am sorry to see such comments because they show how polarized a society we are. For me, I consider myself to be one of those who call an ass an ass and don't care anyone's opposition to anything.",1
711,"Nice Work, Poor Vievers","This movie is not as good as Kirmizigul's previous movies because he tried his writing and directing skills in comedy. He tried something different. It's natural i think. This movie does not deserve that point. In Turkey so many viewers gave it low points because of the government party's voters. They blemished him and his project. They are thinking about Kirmizigul joking to Muslims and Muslim's symbols. They are thinking about he is member of a terrorist group in Turkey(They do not have any clues about this). This is a false charge. Without watching movie, they are just blemishing him.What a shame for Turkish people. I had given it 7 first, but for support i gave 8 for this project.",8
712,what a bummer,"I went to see this movie in the Netherlands with my Turkish friends. In the past I saw some pretty good Turkish movies, so I went to see this movie with let's say a positive prejudice. But this movie turned out a complete failure. I couldn't sit through the whole movie, so I left early. It was god awful. A child wouldn't write this screenplay, that bad. Probably one of the worst movies I ever saw, if not the worst movie. Complete waste of precious time and money, I wouldn't recommend anyone.",1
713,"Waste of time, waste of money","The reason i am writing this review is for those who actually liked Mahsun's previous movies and expect the same quality from this one, however i regret to tell you that you will be upset. I also find that failing with such budget and cast in Turkish movie industry should be really hard yet i consider this movie as a big fail.The humor is so cheap and coarse which makes the movie boring. I see many people are also judging the movie politically which is unfair however you don't need to give this movie a low rating because of your political view but because the movie quality is what it is.",1
714,It is quite good for a comedy,"I have seen many movies like that in turkey especially ""Kahpe Bizans"". In my opinion, this movie is better than Kahpe Bizans. That movie was also making fun of Ottoman time. However, people in turkey didn't quite show any negative reaction. However, when I see that people gave 3.7, the first thing came in my mind these rates are biased (Some local people encourage people to give negative feedback which is not good ). The movie deserves at least 7-8, not 3.7.",10
715,One of the Best movies!,"Don't look at the bad reviews, it was a nice movie. The bad reviews are people who do not know the culture and the language who went to watch the movie, and they didn't understand the jokes and the rumor and gave it a one star because they didn't understand a thing. And the Turkish people who gave it a one star does not support the producer of the writer of this movie, Mahsun Kirmizigul. Some reviews say that even a child wouldn't write the screenplay, the guy doesn't know what he is talking about they cannot even write a sentence of a small scene. So it is easy to talk and blame to movie in many ways, but at the end it was a great movie. All the actors were most famous actors in Turkey. The movie was flowing very nice, in fact I bought more than one ticket to support Mahsun. I loved the story and the way actors played each of their role. It was a different perspective. Don't watch the movie with prejudgment. GO WATCH IT, RECOMMENDED!",10
716,Satire and history,"Beautiful, funny and critical of the abuse of power by religious people.Watched this in the Netherlands and enjoyed it with family.Truly a shame how a collective boycott was organized to make sure this movie was rated so low on IMDB (below 5).It must have offended religious zealots.",9
717,Heartbreaking,"Angelina Jolie proves her directing chops with this feature. It takes place in 1975 as the U.S. military was leaving Vietnam and Cambodia. The Kmer Rouge were taking over, millions of Cambodians were displaced and killed. The star is a little girl who is the screenwriter of the material based on her best selling book. The story is horrific, as the family moves from a comfortable middle class existence to one of deprivation and starvation. The kids are great and the horrors of war are shown with an accurate eye by Ms. Jolie. She is a major talent as both an actress and director. One of the best films of the year.",8
718,The Khmer Rouge Effect through the Eyes of a Girl,"In the 70's, a Cambodian middle-class girl sees the lives of her family and her turning upside-down when the Khmer Rouge invades the Cambodia. They leave their comfortable apartment and lifestyle to live in a primitive working camp. Her father, a former officer, is killed and the family splits to survive.Angelina Jolie once again surprises with another great film about contemporary war and genocide directed by her. ""First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers"" shows the effect of the revolution promoted by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia through the eyes of an innocent seven year-old girl. Her family is separated and they fight to survive in a devastated country. The children have top-notch performances and Angelina Jolie succeeds in exploring the best from each one of them. The ""happy ending"" does not fit well to the storyline and maybe is the unique ""but"", probably imposed by producers. Even those that are not fans of Angelina Jolie with have to respect her work as director. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",7
719,Cambodian genocide,"With such a gut-wrenching subject matter of the Khmer Rouge regime and the memoir being such an emotionally complex read and going full throttle with the horror, 'First They Killed My Father' intrigued from the get go. Also wanted to see how actress Angelina Jolie fared as director, another reason for seeing the film. Saw 'First They Killed My Father' on Neflix a while ago but, as one can tell, it took me a while to get round to reviewing it, due to music commitments, my ""to watch and review"" list getting longer constantly and also that it took a while to gather my thoughts on the film. Can see both sides of the argument of both like and dislike. 'First They Killed My Father' is a very admirable film with a lot of strengths and some very powerful moments, but the memoir and the actual events are much more harrowing.'First They Killed My Father' is an incredibly well made film with some truly beautiful images, evocative production design and atmospheric scenery. Jolie directs more than competently, the visual style is spot on and she does a great job ensuring that the perspective doesn't get too biased or one-sided, like when Loung sees good in the enemy in the scene with the captured soldier. Telling the story through the eyes of a child was a brave choice and makes for a persuasive argument, this way prejudice and politics don't muddle or overshadow the story and the potential trap of being too innocent is thankfully strayed away from.There are moments of great poignancy and power, not just the above scene but also the older sister's murder, the scolding and especially the walk through the blood-stained forest (the closest the film gets to capturing the full horror of what the regime was like). 'First They Killed My Father' is a thought-provoking film too and the message resonates and is still an important one. Loung is a person one identifies with and roots for every step of the way, and Sareum Srey Moch's extraordinary and very touching performance is an enormous part of why.On the other hand, while the restrained approach is laudable and somewhat appreciated rather than going the excessively graphic and potentially gratuitous route, 'First They Killed My Father' doesn't quite go full force dramatically and could have taken more risks. Not be as intrepid in showing the regime's full horrors, which were bloody so the graphic nature actually would have been a valid and necessary approach. Can understand what the film was trying to do, but some genuinely powerful. harrowing and poignant scenes (especially the empathising of the captured soldier, the death of the sister, the scolding and the blood-stained forest) are not quite enough in a film that tends to treat the subject in a way that's too careful, muted and tame. A tighter pace, less of the idyllic lingering shots and images (beautiful they are and some make an emotional impact, but not escaping the traps of self-indulgence, being distracting and not having much to them other than looking good) and more dialogue (which may have given the film more flow and cohesion) would have probably solved this.In conclusion, good admirable film but could have been more. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7
720,Not sure what people want from movie,"The film is Netflix polished with breathtaking scenes and a suspenseful atmosphere. The story is based on truth from a 7 year old girls perspective during the rise of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.Scenes of family survival and the horrors of war hold up well and should be of delight to anyone interested in the politics that engulfed South East Asia during the 1970's.The dialogue in the movie is very basic but I'm left to wonder whether that was the intention as the story is from a small child's perspective trying to make sense of her surroundings.There is very little in character development or details on what is actually happening politically in the movie in most scenes.I would recommend people read into the Khmer Rouge before watching as it would make a more enjoyable movie experience, paying particular attention as the why Western Allied Nations supported such a brutal regime after the fall of Vietnam to the Communists.God bless to all those in Cambodia that lived and died through this troubled time, great movie and certainly brought regular tears to my eyes.",9
721,Short review with no spoilers!,"I saw this in Olympic Stadium earlier this year. The sets and costumes were terrific, as was the cinematography. I wasn't a big fan of the book that it was based on, but it was apparent that a lot of effort had gone into making the film adaptation historically accurate. The film is deliberately understated, and rather than showing much violence or gore, it instead has this implicit threat running below the surface. It's definitely worth seeing!",7
722,An incredibly moving story seen through the eyes of a child,"A movie based on Long Ung's autobiography about her childhood memories as a child soldier during the Khmer Rouge regime. First they Killed my Father is an incredibly moving story. The camera angles are set low and at times the story seems slow, and throughout has little dialogue, but in the end this works well in telling this story from a child's perspective.I did not expect that I would have been so emotional after watching this movie. And several times, I found myself revisiting both the troubling and precious moments portrayed in the film. Perhaps it's because my earliest memories of television are news film of war in Indochina, and the opening scenes briefly show Long Ung standing beside a black and white television, with similar vision playing while the Khmer Rouge are marching down the streets outside. I found myself trying to compare my childhood to hers. For me this alone is powerful. Don't expect any big history questions to be answered or seek to ask who's responsible, this isn't needed to see this story as it would have been seen through the eyes of a child.",8
723,A disappointing film adaptation with a few moving moments...,"As a survivor of the Khmer Rouge regime who has lost many family members during those terrible years (my father included), I was really looking forward to watching Jolie's adaptation of Loung Ung's harrowing book.Nearly four decades have past since the events occurred between 1975 and 1979, and only two major Hollywood films have been scripted out of this genocide which cost the lives of 2 to 3 millions Cambodians (we will never know the true numbers): 'The Killing Fields' and now this Netflix movie.Both movies are complimentary and only provide a very imperfect picture of these dark times (imagine the Holocaust being resumed to 2 movies vs the thousands that currently exist...). Yet, if you don't know much about that part of history, I would advise watching ""The Killing Fields"" first (despite all its flaws - mostly the 80s soundtrack which hasn't aged well), and also Rithy Panh's amazing documentaries such as 'S-21' and 'The Missing Picture'. These movies are far better than 'First they killed my father..."" which is very confounding given that Rithy Panh is also the main producer for this movie, and Loung Ung being the main screenwriter, one would have thought that it could have been a masterpiece.Yet what's really lacking in 'First they killed..."" is the direction and overall storytelling of the piece. It is too produced & polished cinematographically with too many crane/drone shots, too many pretty shots which don't really add to the tragedy and sense of urgency and despair but rather drown it down to a pretty Hollywood/Netflix production.I didn't mind Jolie's previous directorial works, but this one is truly underwhelming and doesn't do justice to the book, nor the torturous experience of the Killing Fields or the excruciating exodus journey that many Cambodians encountered during these 4 infamous years. Don't get me wrong, there are some very emotional scenes in the movie, such as the death of Loung Ung's oldest sister or the scene where her other sister gets scolded by a Khmer Rouge for eating a raw bean she just picked in the fields.No doubt that the challenge of telling the story from the vantage point of a child (the book's inspiration was I believe, Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and contained many more thoughts that gave it such as singular voice) was a hurdle. And I'm sad to say that the lack of voice-over or inner thoughts or even dates & location titling in the movie didn't do the final product any favors, especially for a movie being a POV piece. My guess is that the book was rightfully criticized for being a patchwork of many accounts of the Khmer Rouge years as opposed to just being one single account by a 5-year old girl, and so the movie took on the artistic choice to avoid some of the book's flaws regarding the adult language used by the heroin girl.This ultimately created a movie with very little dialogue, nor context as if the audience is just viewing it from a distant observer's vantage point. Reducing the experience of the Pol Pot regime to just images, sound effects, a few words from the parents and a few repeated phrases uttered by the KR soldiers... and yes some archival footage at the start of the film about the US involvement in the conflict... The multiple dream sequences were particularly cheesy to me and unnecessary showcased the way it was done... It really was detrimental to the storytelling and instead of giving a poetic dimension to the film, gave it a rather Disney kids movie feel.The choice of the main young actress is confounding too... She is very one-dimensional throughout the whole movie, showing the same facial expression from beginning to the end with a few tears here and there. Her accompanying brother and sisters were far better actors, especially her only sister who survives - she was outstanding.As a survivor of the regime, I'm probably too attached to the subject matter. Yet, I feel that this movie had such an important role to play for the Cambodian cause and will play such a role due to it being prominently showcased right now, and I know that the director, producer and writer wanted to do their best given how connected they are to that cause.Ultimately this film is still a valuable watch, especially for those who don't know much about these grim years of terror. It will serve its purpose albeit being a very flawed movie in terms of screenplay, direction and conventional production. Here's hope for more movies about this dark period of history as more people become aware of it.It is technically pristine with nice cinematography, costume and art/set design/production, but lacks urgency, grit, guts, context, direction and purpose by being too attached to wanting to make it look like a movie a la ""Schindler's List""... even the end is reminiscent of some of Spielberg's productions where the real Loung Ung and her surviving family pray in front of Buddhist monks on the grounds of an Angkor Temple... I'm really surprised that Rithy Panh would have used such a cliché to end the movie with... which makes me think that it was probably the director or writer's bad call.For those who want to learn more about the history, watch the other films I mentioned earlier which are far better movies than this Netflix production... Or just read Loung Ung's book if you liked the movie.. or better yet read ""Cambodia Year Zero"" by Francois Ponchaud, or ""When the war was Over"" by Elizabeth Becker as well as Rithy Panh's books.",5
724,Disappointingly mundane,"FIRST THEY KILLED MY FATHER is the high-profile exploration of life under the Khmer Rouge, based on a non-fiction novel and filmed by Angelina Jolie. I found it a somewhat overrated experience that feels overlong and disappointingly mundane, sugar-coating some of the material (this has a happy ending, no less) and toning down all of the violence and depravity that took place in Cambodia in the 1970s. I'm not a gorehound looking for sadistic entertainment, but I did expect something a little more than endless drawn-out scenes of a young girl witnessing death and chaos but somehow always feeling on the outside. There's no real emotional value here, and although the film is very well shot and authentically acted, it just feels like a missed opportunity in comparison to something genuinely powerful like THE KILLING FIELDS.",4
725,Phenomenal film! Highly recommend.,"Exquisite cinematography, phenomenal performances, and a magnificent account of modern day genocide. Based on the incredible memoir by Loung Ung, First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers, tells a haunting story of survival. The images stay with you long after the film concludes, and you're left with an indelible memory of atrocities that are scarcely known. As well as an understanding of how human beings can transcend staggering circumstances. Must see!",10
726,The Killing Fields Revisited,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5) GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An impressive film that authentically addresses the subject of war and, despite some missteps, builds to a powerful conclusion.SYNOPSIS: The true story of a young Cambodian child forced to survive during the Khmer Rouge uprising.JIM'S REVIEW: Opening this weekend, and streaming on Netflix, is Angelina Jolie's powerful docudrama, First They Killed My Father (subtitled A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers), a film that shows war through the eyes of a five year old child. One can readily admire the fortitude and devotion that this actress / director applies to her film. It is a sad and harrowing tale that occurs too often in this violent world of ours. With little dialog, the film tells the compelling tale of Loung Ung (Sareum Srey Moch, making an impressive debut) as she overcomes oppression in order to survive. Using all Cambodian actors speaking their native language, Ms. Jolie wrote the screenplay, along with the author, and she relies on strong visuals to reveal the escalating tensions that once destroyed a small nation. The basic story is involving and realistically viewed, but the movie unfolds at a sluggish pace, especially in the first half hour with too many scenes focusing on the hardships occurring before the actual titled event even happens off-screen. We watch our heroine forced to become a prisoner in an internment camp, along with her family, before becoming a child soldier. Yet the historical aspects of the story are rarely addressed for any moviegoers who may not know the backstory of the rise of the Khmer Rouge regime and the genocide and enslavement that followed in mid-70's Cambodia. (Approximately two million Cambodians were killed due to warfare, starvation, and forced labor.) We see the various happenings that endanger this child and her family but we are also trying to sort out and unravel these sudden and abrupt changes to their everyday existence, mainly through the photo-journalistic approach to the narrative rather than understand the words spoken.Loung Ung's autobiographical memoir about her family becoming casualties of war is told honestly, if a bit one-sided, with the director's sometimes heavy-handed treatment of the Vietnam War and her humanitarian leanings interfering with the film's momentum. There are flashbacks and dream fantasies that simply get in the way of the basic compelling story. Judicious editing would have given the film even more impact. Ms. Jolie's direction starts off shaky and uneven. Her film is wildly accurate and hyper-realistic at times and yet languid and tedious in its details in other moments. Using her ""Sympathy to the Devil"" opening montage with archival newsreel footage and scenes of American involvement in the War Without a Name is a class in Cliché Filmmaking 101. She introduces Ms. Ung's family with their wealthy privileged lifestyle due to her father governmental job and their happy home before slowly beginning to contrast the ""then and now"" aspects of the family's ordeal. Soon they and thousand of other sympathizers are exiled and put into camps and later being separated as a family unit. Yet if one doesn't lose interest and continues on this journey, the film builds to an emotional conclusion. It is in the film's second half where Ms. Jolie delivers with many striking images (a tearful child clutching onto her long lost stuffed animal, a dead body washed ashore and seen by gaping children, child laborers being victimized and abused), All of these images resonate. Her direction is most effective in other scenes of violence and brutality, as in her climactic battle sequence involving land mines that is intensely filmed and riveting. (Special mention to Anthony Dod Mantle for his stunning cinematography.)First They Killed My Father is ultimately an impassioned plea for unity, understanding, and empathy that tries and eventually succeeds as it asks us to remember the past. Ms. Jolie's reverent film serves as a lasting testament to the human spirit.",8
727,"An Extraordinary Movie, Angelina Beyond !!!","Angelina Jolie, brings us another movie, she seems to be getting into this role as a filmmaker. This film that shows the stark reality of the deployment of the Communist regime in Cambodia, through the eyes of the protagonist a girl still, based on the book she wrote of her memories, many years later, is this little treasure that our actress brings us to tell through movie light.It is a visceral film, it shows the authoritarian action of a people that borders on the madness in political terms, an action made of philosophy and arms as it reminds us was of German Nazism. The ""revolutionaries"" try to disqualify everything that had been done so far in the country and put in place a strange world. What is most strange is the fact of speaking in justice, but a justice full of hatred that completely abandons love.In this new world, only the new posture matters, philosophical arguments are used to exploit the work, and the worst, destroying the family cell is something that I imagine is destroying all the noble values ​​of humankind. It was a realization of the collective madness that was disseminated in the world as a new a world-wide solution, which, in fact, only exchanged hands with the holders of power and placed at the center of it the power to impose by force of arms the new power, which took the liberty of all.A visceral film that hurts the soul, and at the same time makes us understand (to whoever really wants, of course) some of the political ways and doctrines that have come to hover over the history of the world and show themselves in the course of history as something that did not comply with the philosophical precepts he preached. I ask you to watch and make your reflections, a film of a haughtiness far above what you see in movies. This goes beyond simple reflection, because it is a film of few dialogues and a lot of description of real facts.",10
728,The movie adaption of the book with the same title. Loung Ung recalled her memory as the Khmer Rough took over the nation.,"First of all, I think the way Jolie directed this movie is beautiful and real. Words couldn't describe how appreciated I am for her to put this bitter history of Cambodia on screen.The only thing that kept bugging my mind is that I didn't feel the sympathy and frights as much as I supposed to do. There were so many times where I felt like the book could be way far better than the action movie (despite the fact that, I haven't even read the book). The movie ravels the story from the perspective of a kid so it is very understandable that there was very few dialog and there could be lots of time where you feel like---blank, nothing. There were times where the girl found herself in the middle of chaos, unable to process whats going on---and while watching such scenes, I could imagine myself intriguing to her thoughts in the book instead. What I mean is, the movie is without doubt, a masterpiece, but I don't think it is the best choice to tell this traumatic event through a kid perspective. Tho I think movie like this need to be produced, I can't deny that there are more cons than the pros for letting adults hear the story of a war from a kid.However, That was the only problem with the movie and it clearly deserves a watch. Especially for those who have known basic history of this event, I think you're going to enjoy it very much. I would definitely watch it all over again any day. (Please excuse all the written mistakes as English is not my native language.)",8
729,A Little Girl Watches As The Khmer Rouge Takes Over Cambodia,"This is a very powerful movie, based on a memoir by Loung Un, that depicts the trials of one family in Cambodia. Opening in Phnom Penh, the family is shown to be happy, prosperous and comfortable, living in a beautiful apartment with few worries. ""Pa"" is an officer in the pro-American government's military. But as the US commitment in neighbouring Vietnam collapses, the US withdraws from Cambodia, and Phnom Penh is overrun with guerrillas from the Khmer Rouge. People are expelled from the city, and the rest of the movie depicts the brutal treatment of the Khmer Rouge toward these refugees who required ""re-education,"" whose personal possessions were taken away and who were forced to work in labour camps, supplying food to the soldiers whole they themselves faced virtual starvation, with many of the children being taught to become killing machines for the new regime. The movie is largely told through the eyes of Loung, and it's certainly eye-opening for viewers, as we're exposed to the inhumanity (on all sides) of warfare.Directed by Angelina Jolie (who I thought did a fabulous job) the film doesn't paint a simplistic portrait of ""Khmer Rouge bad, Americans good."" It was the US that decided to start a bombing campaign in neutral Cambodia, after all, turning much of the rural population against them and those who were looked on as their allies - mainly the city dwellers, and especially former government officials and soldiers. The decision to film the movie in Cambodian (rather than having the actors speak English with Cambodian accents or dubbing the dialogue into English) was a good one that gave even more of a feel of authenticity to this. The portrayal of Loung (by a Cambodian child actress named Sreymoch Sareum) was superb and powerful. Starting out as a fun-loving, somewhat mischievous little girl, the range of emotions shown as she deals with the nightmare she fell into was absolutely raw. I did find that the last half hour (as Loung finds herself first with the Vietnamese and then in a Red Cross camp) was a little bit confusing.It might help if a viewer has a little bit of knowledge about the history of Cambodia in this period and especially about the Khmer Rouge regime, but it's not vital. The story itself lets you know what you need to know and the heartache you feel for Loung (and her siblings, and really everyone who was caught up in this madness as their worlds were turned upside down) is very deep and very real. It's a powerful experience to watch this. (8/10)",8
730,Real,"I only like realistic movies and this is as real as it gets. Incredible acting and directing. I'm still amazed at how they get six year olds to act so authentically. If you like historically accurate movies, this one's for you. If anything, they downplayed the brutality of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge.",8
731,A one-dimensional portrait of a tragic episode,"The Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia attempted to end the class war in the most emphatic fashion, namely by ending the existence of the higher social classes. It evacuated the cities and attempted to construct a peasant nation, forcing so- called intellectuals into brutal work camps. In additionally intentionally killing anyone it identified as an enemy, it moreover brought famine upon those it did not intend to kill (though population reduction was arguably a goal in itself). Few if any other governments are responsible for the deaths of so many of their populations. The story was told famously in 'The Killing Fields', shot shortly after the overthrow of the regime, but Angelica Jolie has now made a new movie about this era, based on the testimony of a survivor. On one hand, 'First They Killed My Father' boldly eschews Hollywood-style narratives; on the other, it also eschews much in the way of explanation. A series of bad things happen to the daughter of a previously prosperous family, and that's all. Without the narrative, one feels this might have been better had it been shot as a documentary reconstruction. It would also have been interesting to learn more about what enabled the rise of the Khmer Rouge and what led Cambodia down such an awful path: the only answer we get is American bombing, but in Vietnam, for example, there was an orthodox communist regime that did not resort to pure genocide. As it is, the film is a worthwhile reminder of what awful things humans can do to each other; but not completely compelling as either story or history.",6
732,Definitely worth a watch.,Very powerful imagery of a (civil) war from the perspective of a little girl. The movie does a good job of building tension and delivering near the end. I can only highly recommend this movie although maybe not to the faint of heart: the minefield scene is especially (and applicably) horrid.,8
733,A visual feast with plenty to chew on after it has finished,"This is a visually very interesting film as it uses lots of different styles of shots to tell the story - from almost POV to put you in the scene, to aerial views which distance yourself, but also are more aesthetic. The story itself is understated and shown rather than told, with a fairly minimal amount of dialogue. The story itself is tragic and fascinating, and as it is based on a true story, also horrifying. And whilst it bears comparison with The Killing fields, the fact that it shows how children were turned into soldiers and killers make it almost a counterpoint to that film.",8
734,Excellent moving account of a history,"Angelina Jolie is a superb director in this film. Perfect casting, great cinematography and staging, fluid story. Seeing the events from the point of view of a child really impressed me and conveyed all the horror of that conflict. Jolie has shown that she is a sensitive individual who does not follow Hollywood mediocre guidelines; she is led by intelligence, knowledge and a strong instinct to deliver a message to the world.",10
735,Extremely slow and boring despite the subject matter.,"First They Killed My Father is a new film directed by Angelina Jolie that documents one girl's journey through the horrific Cambodian genocide. This is a completely foreign film, with the only English being the news footage in the beginning, and it is filmed entirely in Cambodia. Going into this movie I wanted an emotional experience that would enthrall me from beginning to end, similar to Beasts of No Nation or even 12 Years a Slave. Despite that, I still try to keep my expectations even. I cannot tell you how often I checked the time. This film dragged on like few other films I have seen recently have, and that is exponentially disappointing. Basically all that happens in this film are the main characters moving from place to place, and scenes where people say goodbye. That's about it. I'm not trying to criticize any movie for not having enough happening, because films can be great and meaningful without having any major action scenes. With that being said, First They Killed My Father is just plain boring, and there is not enough meaning behind it to invest me into every single scene. There are entire sequences that show the protagonists just working, and I feel like they could have edited it down a little to not make the film drag so much. I also think that the filmmakers could have showed a little bit more of what the main girl's life was like before the events. They reduces this to one scene near the beginning and some flashback images, but this doesn't feel like enough. However, it is not all bad. Angelina Jolie puts a lot of artistry into her direction here, with some very unique point of views. There is also a lot of talent in most of the performances, who emote the experiences that they are going through wonderfully. The cinematography is also beautiful, making this a very good looking film.Unfortunately, none of these good things can save a painfully dull film. Given the interesting subject matter, you'd think that this would instantly be a masterpiece, but sadly that was not the case. Jolie tries to let the subject matter do the work for her, and that isn't enough.I give First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers a C.",5
736,Something Missing,"Short review, with SPOILERS. I must echo KDL, who hit the nail on the head. How can a film about the ferocious atrocities perpetrated upon the Cambodian people by the Khmer Rouge be so unemotional? If you want to see a more graphic representation of the horrors unleashed by the fanatical zealots of the Khmer, then see ""The Killing Fields.""If you want to feel the emotional despair and witness the subjection to violence experienced by those taken and driven to an unspeakable primal existence, then see ""The Killing Fields.""If you want to get a complete understanding of the depths of depravity to which the Khmer Rouge sunk, read ""A Cambodian Odyssey,"" by Haing Ngor, the actor who portrayed Dith Pran in ""The Killing Fields."" His personal story, having himself been taken prisoner by the Khmer, was arguably even more horrific than the role he played on film.I can understand the attempt to present the story through the eyes of a child and the child's bewilderment of what was playing out before her young eyes, stripping away her innocence in the worst way imaginable. But narration was not the way to go.The film quality was fine and the actors did their jobs for the most part. But just doing their job is not enough to save the film from becoming mired in what results as a rather sluggish attempt at retelling the hell of the Cambodian genocide.Save for one or two scenes (i.e., realizing she has been caught in a mine field while trying to flee the Khmer Rouge), the young Sareum Srey is not given the chance to convey to the audience the full effect of what the child had to face.",5
737,A hard destiny,"""First they killed my father"" tells the story of a young Cambodian girl that flees from the Communists alongside her family, which partly worked for the government. On their long way under the new regime, the family gets separated, tortured and killed. The dream of masses of people turns into a nightmare before her eyes, while her world gets turned upside down.What we see in this movie is plainly awful. We see a young child, who doesn't understand what is happening while politics tear her life apart. The production is of high value, even though in my eyes the movie is a bit long and could have been told in fewer time. This girl is exemplary for many destinies throughout this happenings, which makes the film both important, but at the same time prevent a very individual connection to the main characters. In a way it is more a political statement than a blockbuster.All in all this is a movie for those who want to gain more insight into this particular period of history. It is tremendous and horrifying, but it is, unfortunately, not an excellent film.",7
738,A heart-wrenching masterpiece,"Angelina Jolie's masterpiece.This Netflix movie covers a topic that few Americans are familiar with: The Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide.The setting and camera work does justice to make sure the audience feels as if they are in 1970s Cambodia. The acting feels completely believable. Attention to detail will make you forget you're living in the present. You will feel as if you're living in a child's head.Based on a true story, the plot itself was heart wrenching and sad. The story twists and turns but the ending leaves one feeling happy and full of tears.5/5. A must-watch for those interested in the history of Cambodia. God bless those who survived the Khmer Rouge regime.",10
739,"Despite a charming cast, the film suffers from a host of unlikable characters and a silly storyline","Julia Roberts seems to be one of the most hated celebrities on this website. I can't really understand why. I find her to be talented and charming as well as engaging and usually likable, until I saw Runaway Bride. I thought I was going to like this one but it offered some of the most unlikable characters I have ever seen in a romantic comedy. Generally, the audience should want to cheer for the two people to get together but I couldn't care less. I don't think Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) actually deserved to be in a marriage because she was selfish, immature and seemed incapable of love. I just couldn't fathom why anyone would actually be attracted to her. She has weddings like there no big deal and she probably wasted a lot of money between the four failed ones she had. She has her fiancé invest all of his time into the relationship, trying to show her that he does indeed love her only to be left at the altar. I guess the situation was supposed to be humorous and I shouldn't have taken it so seriously but it was tough to overlook all of the garbage the film was trying sell to me.Acting wise the film was decent, which did save it a little. Julia Roberts gives an okay performance, although it's one of her worst. However, she is working with rather weak material and she's portraying a woman that is just so hard to like. Richard Gere was also decent although nothing special. The chemistry between these two was basically non-existent which made their relationship seem completely fake and unrealistic. It was hard to buy that a cynical man would fall for a woman that has no problem trampling all over a man's heart. They did have a few funny scenes together though which made the film more enjoyable. Unfortunately, the film runs for an inexplicable 116 minutes so there are a lot of dead spots.Romantic comedies shouldn't really be loathsome movies. The characters should be likable and engaging so it's easy to get behind them and the story shouldn't be too far-fetched. Unfortunately, Runaway Bride commits the worst sin for a romantic comedy by offering unlikable characters, making it basically impossible to really get into the movie despite how talented the cast may be.",5
740,"You know what? Don't tell me anything about Pretty Woman, because I don't even want to hear it.","Runaway Bride is just a good romantic comedy. Yes, the director and the two big name stars are the same as the film's 1990 counterpart, but even though the two films have striking and almost offensive similarities, Runaway Bride has a good enough story that I refuse to believe that it relied on the success of its predecessor. Julia Roberts is Maggie Carpenter, a hardware store owner (a laughable profession surpassed only by Denise Richards as a nuclear weapons specialist in The World Is Not Enough. Yeah RIGHT!), and Richard Gere is a newspaper columnist (Ike Graham) who has been fired for printing a supposedly false column about a woman who consistently runs out on her marriages. When he travels to the tiny town where she lives to learn more about her life and possibly get his job back, he finds that there is more to her than just a newspaper column. By the end of the film, there is such a huge media hype about Maggie's wedding that it's a wonder that Ike wasn't honored for his 'false' column about her. Joan Cusack has never looked and acted better than she did in this movie, delivering a wonderful nasally performance that was strangely heartwarming. Runaway Bride had all kinds of wonderful scenes. I particularly liked the wedding rehearsal scene. The look on Christopher Meloni's face was priceless! There were so many good things about this film that I am able to overlook the superficial look of unoriginality. If you just look past the director and the two big names, the story itself is not at all like any other film. There will, of course, be the inevitable cynical comparisons to Pretty Woman, and these complaints are understandable, but people who condemn Runaway Bride as a rip-off of Pretty Woman or some sort of re-make are simply not looking at the film, but only at the names on the bill. This is a very good romantic comedy, and it should not be missed simply because of a superficial comparison to Pretty Woman.",8
741,Sweet Comedy,"Anybody who doesn't like the director Gary Marshall's ""Runaway Bride"" must be a curmudgeon. This harmless but hilarious romantic comedy about a bride with a chronic case of cold feet who abandons her men at the altar before van vow ""I Do"" reunites ""Pretty Woman"" co-stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere after a nine year hiatus. While the big city ""Pretty Woman"" tied the romantic knot between a lonely investment banker and a hot, awesome street walker of a babe, ""Runaway Bride"" retreats deep into the country to bring a gray-haired, chauvinistic USA Today columnist eyeball-to-eyeball with a flirtatious but fickle-minded maiden who owns a local hardware store. Aside from a couple of bittersweet moments, ""Runaway Bride"" emerges as luminous and lighthearted as Julia's radiant smile.Although most of the comedy in ""Bride"" occurs in the small town of Hale, Maryland, this entertaining battle of the sexes opens in a cozy, New York City neighborhood bar where fast-talking cynic Ike Graham (Richard Gere of ""Red Corner"") is searching desperately for either something or somebody to skewer in his daily column. Ike loves to infuriate woman, and many of them take a whack at him on the street with his own newspaper as if he were a mangy mutt. After director Garry Marshall and co-scenarists Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, who together wrote ""Worth Winning"" and ""The Favor,"" establish that he is a last-minute journalist, Ike hears a story that he embellishes with his sarcastic wit. A jilted groom tells Kike about a hysterical dame in Maryland who accepts marriage proposals but skips out on the way to the altar at the last minute, catching a ride on truck or horse if either is available to make good her getaway.Unfortunately, Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts of ""Ocean's Twelve"") compiles a laundry list of Ike's inaccuracies. This prompts Ike's ex-wife turned editor, Ellie (Rita Wilson of ""The Story of Us""), to fire him. No sooner has poor Ike gotten sacked than Fisher (Hector Elizondo of ""Valdez Is Coming""), Ike's good friend and a photographer that free-lances for GQ magazine, concocts revenge for our hero. If Ike can catch Maggie in flight from her next wedding, GQ will publish his story and Ike's reputation will be restored.When Ike arrives in Hale, Maryland, a community so harmonious that the town's barbershop quartet performs regularly in public, Maggie is working on fiancé number four, Bob (Christopher Meloni of ""Twelve Monkeys""), a high school football coach. Of course, Maggie wants nothing to do with Ike, but Ike isn't easily shunned. Initially, as a joke during his first interview with her, Maggie and her hairdresser friends dupe Ike and dye his mane the colors of the rainbow. Later, Ike cozies up with Maggie's family. Before long, he has the entire town eating out of his hand as he learns more about Maggie's dysfunctional lifestyle. Eventually, instead of hating one another, Ike and Maggie become attracted to each other, much to Bob's chagrin.Hopelessly predictable as it is, ""Runaway Bride"" qualifies nevertheless as a lot of fun, especially if you're looking for a bright, infectiously funny comedy to lighten your mood.",8
742,"Predictable in terms of plot, but very well played","Runaway Bride is an enjoyable romantic comedy. Yes, it isn't perfect, the story is very predictable and repetitive, the direction is perhaps a little too leisurely in some parts and there are parts when very little happens. But it is a very well played romantic comedy at that. The script is full of very funny one-liners and quotes. Whilst I had a few problems with the story, the script was fine. Julia Roberts makes the most of her role as the title character, and Richard Gere, her co-star in Pretty Woman, is his usual charming self as the somewhat over familiar love interest, and Joan Cusack is enjoyable as Roberts's friend who gives her the odd piece of advice throughout the film.All in all, not too bad. It is predictable, like I have said too many times already, but it is well played and well scripted, so not so bad to pass the time. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7
743,A wonderful romantic comedy. Quite funny.,"When a film has great dialogue and the actors to add credibility to the script they are given, then I would say 8 times out of ten I will take that film over big budgeted special effects laden films that are high on the latest CGI technology and short on entertainment.  Of course some of the most entertaining films are one that can combine the two(Armageddon, Deep Impact, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark.)  But when you put a film like American Pie or this one up against films like The Haunting and Wild Wild West, I'll take American Pie and Runaway Bride any day of the week and twice on Sundays.  This is just a fun film and it is one that entertains right to the very end.This is not a retread of Pretty Woman and the two leads do not reprise their roles from the aforementioned film.  It is directed by Marshall and it has some of the same supporting cast, but that does not make it a replica. Hector Elizondo is a wonderful actor and he adds panache to any film that he takes on.  So it is smart to use some of the same formula that made a film such a success.  Gere has done some of my favourite performances in film, some of them being Dennis Peck from Internal Affairs and also his character from Primal Fear.  You can add Ike to that resume.  Here, at first he is someone that you are not so fond of.  He seems to have slimy intentions.  As all reporters, he seems to be looking for a story and damn who he hurts in the process.  But then we get to meet him for real.  When he interacts with small town folks, he has a side to him that is humourous, warm, caring, empathetic and charming.  And in a way he is almost like Maggie.  Because at first when we meet her, there really isn't much to like about her.  She is exactly what everyone says she is.  She commits to a marriage and then at the most inopportune time, she ditches her fiancee and runs off.  That is not someone that I would choose to call a friend.  But as the film moves forward, we see some of what it is that has her hesitant about marriage and then we get to see similar traits that Ike has.  And we learn to like her. I also liked the fact that the screen play was intelligent enough not to make us hate some of the guys that she was going to marry, especially the fourth one.  He seemed like a decent guy that was just a little too into his sports, and she wasn't.  But that is no reason to hate a guy, it just means that he isn't quite what she was looking for.  And in films, when the screenplay calls for the woman to start disliking the man, it makes the man do things that are just plain ridiculous so that we can start to hate him and the new couple can now get together with the audiences approval.  But we don't get that here.  The fourth guy never really does anything to be an ass, and he even shows support to the two would be lovers at the end.  That was refreshing.  I also wanted to mention grandma and Joan Cusack.  Grandma had many of the funny lines in the film and she was a joy to watch.  And as usual, Cusack steals every second of screen time she has with anyone.  It's not just that her part is written homourously, it's that she carries it so well.  I love watching Joan Cusack on screen and this is a perfect role for her.Garry Marshall is great for this kind of film and he doesn't miss a thing in here.  He and his wonderful cast do an excellent job of keeping us entertained and humoured for 2 hours and I am glad I saw this film.Runaway Bride is sweet, romantic and it will make you want to hug your partner after the movie.  And if you aren't dating or married, it will make you want to fall in love.  It is a great film and I highly recommend it.",8
744,"""Don't knock drunk guys in bars.""","This is an absolutely reasonable chick flick if that's what you're looking for, and it doesn't really get any deeper than that. It has all the makings of a perfectly predictable story line, with a twist that you probably won't expect at the finale, but then it gets back on track to make it to the finish line. I did think Julia Roberts over acted some her scenes where she didn't come across as natural, while Richard Gere coasted through the story in the most suave and debonair manner to win over the family and friends of Maggie Carpenter (Roberts). The story does deliver a number of humorous situations and some of the dialog is pretty clever, so you get a liberal helping of laughs and romance while watching. Even Christopher Meloni's character is let down rather easily in his bid to finally succeed in tying the knot with Maggie, as his hopes are dashed before even arriving at the altar. Although none of the supporting players are real heavyweights, they do carry the ball well when their turn comes up, one of the funniest being Jean Schertler's turn as Grandma. As a comedy, this is about as light as they come, and fans of the principals ought to be well pleased.",7
745,A silly and formulaic charmer,"Despite its formulaic and silly story, Runaway Bride is still a charmer. Julia Roberts has a charisma that buoys up every scene that she's in, even though Richard Gere comes off a little wooden and I don't completely buy their blooming relationship. This romantic comedy swings for the fences and, despite not hitting a home run, it's a movie I wouldn't mind watching again every now and then.",7
746,9th highest grossing film of 1999.....It did not deserve it.,"This is one of the worst mainstream romcoms I've ever seen. The movie follows big city columnist Ike who writes a story about small town Maggie who's become a local legend for how many times she's run away from weddings leaving her groom to be at the alter. After Ike loses his job he goes to Maggie's home town to seek vindication and sparks supposedly begin to fly.Runaway Bride is a bad movie. It has unlikable characters played by uninvested actors acting out an unbelievable premise in a chemistry free and toxic love story that honestly feels more stalkerish at first than like a genuine meet cute. The movie costs $70 Million none of which can be seen on the screen and its humor alternates between cringing Disney channel ""wah wah"" shenanigans to folks ""oh gosh"" small town type humor, and to rather creepy segments including a sequence where Ike obtains a topless photo of Maggie and won't give it back. I HATED this movie and wanted to throw my TV out the window after watching it. Joan Cusack however was enjoyable and what few laughs I did get came from her. She's an underrated actress.",3
747,c-a-b-d,"I found ""Pretty Woman"" charming, and I suppose I still do, but in one respect its storyline is contrived.  (In ONE respect? I hear you ask.  Well, maybe more than one, but only one that worries me.)  This much of the standard formula a light love story MUST follow: (a) boy falls in love with girl, (b) girl falls in love with boy, (c) obstacle, (d) union.  Timing is surprisingly unimportant.  It doesn't matter when (c) is established - it can be before the curtain rises, or half an hour before it falls - nor does it matter if (a) and (b) are simultaneous, or over an hour apart.  (And obviously it doesn't matter which one comes first.  Even the order c-b-d-a is acceptable.)  The trouble with ""Pretty Woman"" is (c).  So she's a prostitute.  So what?  It's a pity that twentieth-century writers have somehow acquired the idea that external obstacles are less interesting than internal ones: it isn't true, and in any event, internal obstacles are harder to draw convincingly.Which is why (FINALLY, I get to the point) ""Runaway Bride"" is a more pleasant confection than ""Pretty Woman"".  Believe me, you don't know how surprised I am to find myself writing this.  Before I saw the movie I was all but certain it would be deathly stale.  The premise - love blossoms between an insulting newspaper columnist and a serial jilter he writes about - screamed, ""This will spend two hours going nowhere"" at me ... and the curious thing is, now that I've seen the film, I can't even remember why I found the idea so unpromising.  Maybe I was unduly swayed by the last Julia Roberts romantic comedy I saw, ""I Love Trouble"", which was at once thin, bloated, and flat.""Runaway Bride"" is none of these things.  It's over two hours, but none of this is bloat: it takes its time because it NEEDS this time, given obstacle (c), to convincingly establish (a) and (b).  The film doesn't waste our time any more than it wastes our own.  I was never bored; very often I was even basking in the glow.  Tastes in romantic comedy are hard to justify or defend, so I'll leave it at that.",8
748,Great Movie!,"Awesome movie! A very funny romantic comedy, with a good resolution. Roberts and Gere have great chemistry and should have an award for it. Never a boring part, always action! Must see for romantic comedies! A few suggestions not appropriate for children, but over all it was pretty clean. Joan Cusac did an excellent job as well, playing Robert's best friend. Very real and believable movie, with plenty of good morals. Overall it is a hilarious movie that keeps you laughing and has you repeating lines constantly until you laugh even more. It is older, so there are a few dated things, but it isn't that bad. Once again, hilarious. Good family things too. This rates up there with You've Got Mail and While You Were Sleeping. A must see for all!",8
749,Don't Runaway From This One...,"This movie is supposed to be hilarious. It's not.  It is a cute ROMANTIC-comedy.  Anyone who knows anything about this genre realizes and understands this does not indicate some psycho babbling funny, teenage, chick flick.  It is actually both romantic and entertaining.  I enjoyed it greatly.  The unfortunate problem with reuniting great actors in a movie after already having a success is that everyone expects some great magic and to relive that same thing.  However, each movie must be taken on it's on frames so there...Anyway, most will recall the team up of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in two similiar yet completely different films known as Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail.  I like both of these films for thier own independence not relying on the previous to get them through the next.  Now, with that said, Runaway Bride is good movie.  It's not great, but it is a good movie.  And it touches many subjects that are life relevant.  Sure it exaggerates it and makes it glamorous but all movies do and it's necessary to make it believable.  Kind of ironic, ain't it?  Anyway, go rent this one or buy it or whatever and then you'll know what I'm talking about.",8
750,Let it grow on you.....,"When I first saw this movie, following the wonderful ""Notting Hill,"" I was less than thrilled.  However, I have watched and watched and watched ""Runaway Bride"" and it really is a witty romance.  What is particularly poignant about the film is the chemistry between Gere and Roberts.  Though it seems very fast, it is completely natural for fans of ""Pretty Woman,"" who saw these two fall in love a decade earlier.Roberts is wonderful in this movie.  She is completely comfortable, natural, and highly believable as the spunky Maggie Carpenter.  Gere is cocky, weathered, and attractive as the misguided Ike Graham.  The plot is predictable, but the first act is snappy and the climax is well-done. It may not please most people on the first run, but rent it again and you'll begin to see the subtleties that make it great.",8
751,"so bad, it comes off more like a fantasy than a comedy or romance","If you really want to suspend your belief, see this movie. This is a movie about a woman who leaves a guy at the altar. One would think that she'd be more careful in her next relationship, but instead she leaves another guy at the altar. And if you're thinking that both the woman AND her potential suitors have learned their lessons by now, another guy proposes to her and ANOTHER guy is left at the altar.What a charming woman, huh? Jeez, no wonder Richard Gere fell in love with this horrible, stupid woman who has decided last-minute to dump THREE guys! Why do the two of them fall in love? More importantly, are we even supposed to take Julia Roberts's side? Let's look at what she did:
After Gere wrote a TRUE article about her, she complained to the newspaper and got him fired. Then when he shows up in her hometown, she dyes his hair ridiculous colors. Then in order to investigate his article more fully, Gere is forced to pay her a LOT of money. And after they ""fall in love"", it only gets worse from there.SPOILERS:Then, after Roberts has supposedly found her one true love, this horrible woman has the gall to run away from her FOURTH marriage, with a guy she LOVES! And why? The reason given is that he doesn't make eye contact with her! But after that, she goes BACK and marries him! What kind of horrible, insane woman is this?END OF SPOILERSThis is one of the worst, most ridiculously written movies I have ever seen. The acting is nothing to be desired either, as some other commenters noticed. It tried to be ""Pretty Woman"", but it fell flat on its face. The eggs thing was some of the stupidest writing ever (if you really want to know how Julia likes her eggs watch the scene in ""America's Sweethearts"" where she goes on an eating binge). However, if you're the kind of person who can ignore the writing and the acting just because you feel good when Roberts and Gere kiss, this is a movie for you. But if this is true, I hope I never meet you.",1
752,Big budget=big failure=big garbage,"I am really becoming tired of coming across some 'generic' users' comments about movies such as: 'With a bigger budget, this film would certainly have been better'Runaway Bride, in my opinion, perfectly belies this too many heard statement: I wonder how many millions of dollars have been USELESSLY WASTED to make this stupid, boring and absolutely not funny movie: it is overwhelmed by clichés and extremely stupid dialogs with a thousand times overused storyline. Moreover, I also wonder how many millions Richard Gere and Julia Roberts 'earned' for their BAD ACTING. But, of course, many people will unfortunately still give some credit to this piece of garbage, for the only reason that the director Gary Marshall had directed 'Pretty Woman' nine years before and that he cast Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. However, here I say: STOP! What is more important than money and will always be in order to make a good movie is THE BRAIN and I fear that this time Mr Marshall lost his. I also sympathize with probable thousands of hundreds of people who walked out of the theaters feeling robbed of their money and with others who will buy the DVD (Moreover, with this awful NTSC standard) Fortunately, I am extremely glad I didn't have to pay a single cent for it, because I saw it on TV. but I still feel that they STOLE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE, which is infuriating me enough. So I sharply encourage people who think like me to give a 1 to this so-called movie to send it to where, despite its big budget and misbegotten pretension, it belongs: THIS IS A PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR THE IMDb BOTTOM 100!!!",1
753,Not good....,"In PRETTY WOMAN, Julia was a prostitute and the public embraced the film. So, naturally, in this film they made her, in some ways, even more unlikable--as a selfish woman who makes it a habit to leave men at the alter. Again and again, she walks out of these men's lives at the last possible second and we are asked to care about her? Frankly, after leaving nice guy after nice guy, I just didn't like her. Plus, this being a formulaic film, you KNOW that despite all this, Richard Gere MUST in the end marry this bimbo! You don't totally hate his character, but considering that he knows all about her past and he STILL wants to marry her, he is in the end revealed to be a total fool.In romance movies we are often asked to suspend disbelief. I can do this and often do with films. But, in this case we are asked to suspend our brains! This I cannot do and encourage you to demand more from a film.While from a technical aspect this isn't a horrible film, but the message it gives viewers is.",3
754,"Whoa! Did they just steal my money, or what?","Are they kidding? This film actually made more money at the US box office than Notting Hill did. That kind of tells you something about american women....It's the worst piece of crap I've seen in ages. Relying solely on Julias somewhat charming smile. Gere is sleepwalking through this whole movie (his life?). Joan Cusack is phoning it in. And the story! Don't get me started on the story, folks. The lamest excuse to ever reteam these two people is hereby in the can.No, if you must see a Julia Roberts film, tune in Notting Hill instead. It will actually be remembered in the future.",1
755,The stars coast through on their built-in good will...,"""Runaway Bride"" reunites ""Pretty Woman"" stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts with their director on that film, Garry Marshall; it does not aspire to be art, but neither is it especially warm or witty or funny. The picture creaks along like an antiquated piece of romantic machinery. Roberts plays an alter-shy would-be bride whose actions have intrigued newspaper man Gere. When he goes to meet her to write his story, naturally he's smitten by her nearly-hidden vulnerability (she rebels at her own feelings for him, saying, ""You wouldn't know love if it bit you in the armpit""--easily the single worst line in the picture). The soundtrack selections are a heavy-handed lot, from the U2 song which opens the movie to Miles Davis' ""It Never Entered My Mind"" improbably underscoring a romantic moment (the jazz instrumental is actually more appropriate for a breakdown scene). The stars do have great chemistry, the supporting cast is colorful yet not overly-eccentric, and it's a fine bauble for anyone in the mood for a generic romantic comedy (and, true, it's probably better than ""Pretty Woman"", which I didn't particularly like). However, from a filmmaker's standpoint, ""Bride"" seems to have been concocted from a connect-the-dots book. They didn't make this movie to stand the test of time; it's disposable. **1/2 from ****",6
756,Cute and mildly entertaining romantic comedy,"I'm normally a huge Julia Roberts fan and while I found this romantic comedy entertaining enough, it cannot compare with her fabulous earlier movie, Pretty Woman, also starring Richard Gere. Nor did I care for it as much as her other comedy romances (most notably Notting Hill) or most of the Meg Ryan ones, especially Sleepless in Seattle.The story revolves around a lovely young woman, Maggie Carpenter, who has left a series of three would be grooms partway through their wedding ceremony. A reporter named Ike Graham gets fired after writing an exaggerated article of half truths on her story, so to salvage his career, he travels to her small hometown, where he attempts to ferret out her true tale and get the scoop on her upcoming fourth nuptials. Needless to say, Ike does not prove very popular with his journalistic subject, Maggie, as he harasses her family & friends for info. However, he begins to feel protective of her when townsfolk mock her track record of jilting her fiancé at the altar.Julia Roberts is invariably appealing & sympathetic in her roles, and typically this proves true in her portrayal here of Maggie. Richard Gere is competent as the journalistic vulture, Ike. I don't fault the lack of chemistry as much as the story, which simply isn't as good as Pretty Woman.Of course romantic comedies are never exactly bastions of realism, but this tale where such a young woman has already run away from three weddings and is now embarking upon number four, really seems too far fetched even for this genre. One would suspect that any prospective groom would be quite leery by now, and why does Maggie keep planning these gala ceremonies if she suspects she might ultimately get cold feet? All in all, it's a cute, light hearted, & entertaining movie with some good scenes, but definitely not the best of its genre. For sure, it lacks the magic of Pretty Woman but judge this one on its own merits.",6
757,Do not runaway from the chance to see this darling and touching romcom,"Ike (Richard Gere) writes a column for a major New York City newspaper. But, he's a ""last-minute"" man, that is, he works better under pressure to complete each piece, barely making the paper's deadlines. One day, the inspiration pipeline is running dry and he grabs at a last minute tip to conjure up a column about a very cold-footed bride, Maggie (Julia Roberts) who has run away from the altar three times. Getting the facts seriously wrong means bye-bye Ike, as his boss and ex-wife (Rita Wilson) lets him go to avoid a lawsuit. Naturally, Ike is dismayed but, then, he is courted by another paper to do an in-depth study of Maggie, for she is about to walk down the aisle again in a matter of days. Traveling to the small city of Hale, Maryland, Ike sets up residence in the town's lovely inn and starts snooping. However, very shortly, the whole village, including Maggie, knows he's there and friends and neighbors try mightily to impede his investigation. They do this because they all have hope that Maggie's fourth nuptials will result in a marriage to the town's high school football coach, Bob (Chistopher Meloni). But, even with best friend Peggy (Joan Cusack) hovering around Maggie, could our Mags somehow be attracted to the handsome Ike, even when he's out to expose her foibles? This is a warm, funny, and touching romcom about the uncertainties in attraction, love, and marriage. How does one know for sure that their beloved is THE one? The answer here is that one must first know oneself well. The cast is a delight, with Roberts and Gere shining brightly in roles that are not necessarily predictable. The supporting troupe is also wonderful, as Cusack, Meloni, Wilson, Hector Elizondo, and others are as entertaining as they come. As for the setting, the lovely little Maryland town in the film is most beautiful and the costumes, photography, script and direction are all worthy, too. So, do not runaway from the chance to see this darling little romcom. It has some very fine lessons, love, and laughter to offer audiences of any age.",8
758,"This is a funny, funny movie.","As much I have to admit I enjoyed the gross-out humor of AUSTIN POWERS and THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, its nice to see a movie that manages to be funny without resorting to non-stop vulgarity. There's a lot of really good material in this one.  As far the story goes, its pretty obvious to anyone with anyone with half a brain (spoiler warning) the two lead will get together in the end.  Besides that, the story isn't too predictable, and the cast is outstanding.  The whole Gere/Roberts chemistry is there, and the rest of the cast gets their good lines in too. This isn't your average ""chick flick,"" this is funny stuff.  And its good clean fun.",7
759,Pales in comparison,"Ike Graham (Richard Gere) is a famous NY newspaper columnist. He meets a stranger George Swilling (Reg Rogers) in a bar who tells him about a small town girl Maggie Carpenter (Julia Roberts) who ran out on him. Ike writes about the Runaway Bride in his column. Maggie gets angry and writes a letter with 15 factual errors. He gets fired by his ex-wife Ellie (Rita Wilson) for the actionable mistakes that could get the paper sued. He goes to do some research on Maggie. If she runs away again, then he would have a front page story. This time Maggie is engaged for the fourth time, this time to high school football coach Bob Kelly (Christopher Meloni). He comes to town and stirs up a whole lot of trouble.Director Garry Marshall has the ability to get great actors. He reunites the 'Pretty Woman' team along with a lot of good comedic talents. The problem is that this movie pales in comparison. Julia Roberts still has that winning smile. There is a lot more salt in Richard Gere's hair. The romance isn't quite there this time. Their characters don't like each other and the inevitable unimaginative turn feels forced. It would make more sense if the turn didn't happen. If Marshall wants to make a rom-com out of this, Ike Graham should be Cupid rather than Prince Charming. It would be a more compelling poetic turn if a long time townie friend actually knows how she likes her eggs. Everything after the turn in Ike and Maggie is a waste of time.",5
760,Not bad for a 'fourth' go-around...,"""Boys Life 4"" continues the successful series of short films about gay men.The first story is called ""L.T.R."" (ie. Long Term Relationship) which focuses on the lives of two young men aged 20 and 21 (ie. 'twinks') who fall in love and believe that it will last forever. An amateur film-maker documents their entire relationship from week one... right through to week four. One of the boys is very much a responsible home-maker while the other is a pot-head. The dynamics of their relationship recall the days of young love and how immature and inexperienced two young men can be. Some of the funnier high-lights include interviews with their friends and their take on the relationship, along with some personal 'interaction' with the film-maker himself.The second story is called ""O Beautiful"" and tells the story of a young gay man who is attacked and sexually molested by a group of homophobic men in a New Jersey cornfield, and is then rescued by one of his attackers who returns after everyone else leaves. This would probably be the most drawn-out story of the four. It is hard to say whether these two men build a friendship, or more of an understanding when they spend the entire trying 20 minutes of the story talking about being gay, dealing with it and where to go from there. I actually felt that this was the most boring out of the four stories and probably the most cliched, especially the scene where the attacker breaks out into a rendition of ""O Beautiful"" for no other real reason  than to cause the viewer irritation and drum in the fact that 'THIS IS AN INDEPENDENT FILM! YOU MUST LOVE ME!'. For those who are interested, there is only one shot of male 'nudity' in Boys Life 4 and you will find it in ""O Beautiful"".The third story is called ""Bumping Heads"" and is a bittersweet story of an older man in his 40's who falls in love with a young drug-abusing man in his 20's who designs hats. The two meet at a party where they, 'bump heads' while reaching for a can of beer. Their friendship builds when they go out to a nightclub and again, 'bump heads' while looking around the club at the people dancing. The story is partly told in flashbacks from a hospital room where the older man has a bloody patch on his head and the younger man is angry at him for starting a fight. We discover what happened through the telling of the incidents leading up to this to what actually happened at the nightclub. There are some funny lines from the female Doctor at the hospital, but other than that, the ending leaves your mouth feeling a little sour.The fourth and story is called ""This Car Up"", referring to an elevator in an office building and the budding relationship that is about to be explored by a bored office worker and a bicycle courier. This would have to be my favorite story of the four. The two men appear to be very superstitious about love, the office worker always referring to his 8-ball for answers, while the bicycle courier counts his odds by flipping quarters. The story is told in split-screen style with a set of spinning poker slots above their heads that tell you what they're currently thinking. I thought the format was clever and extremely funny and the outcome is very comforting. Definitely one of the cutest stories in the Boys Life series.All in all, I was very pleased with Boys Life 4. The series is certainly not tired and with the continuing addition of fresh and innovative story-tellers and directors, I predict Boys Life to continue on for quite some time.My Rating - 7 out of 10",7
761,nice film,"This was the first of the series that I have seen, having nothing else to do this afternoon and having seen most everything else in theatres that I wanted to see.  SPOILERS HEREINThe first segment, entitled ""L.T.R,"" chronicles the relationship of two young twenty something boys (emphatically ""boys"") who meet and ""fall in love.""  They invite a videographer to tape a documentary about the weeks that follow until the relationship is shown to take a turn that neither boy expects.  Hopefully, what transpires in the weeks that pass teaches the boys that there is a marked difference between love and lust.  This one is by far and away the funniest segment.""O Beautiful,"" the second segment, was by far and away the most touching. It begins with a boy having just been sexually violated and beaten up by other boys in a dark cornfield.  We're spared seeing the attack as the scene begins immediately thereafter.  The victim is approached by a young man who arrives on the scene and does what he can to comfort the victim first by wiping the blood from the boy's face, giving him his jeans, and later his letterman's jacket.  The ""rescuer"" at one point starts to sing ""America the Beautiful"" at one point while they are engaged in debate over the victim's homosexuality and the brutality of the attack.  The rescuer advises the victim in a none too tactful way that he was essentially a victim because his actions displeased God.  Although the boy who rescues the victim at first tells him that he left the scene before the attack began, he later admits that he stood and watched while the attackers stripped the boy naked from the waist down and allegedly violates him with a stick.  Obviously, it's a stretch of suspended belief that the guy is not bleeding to death from the damage that such an act would cause his internal organs.  The segment ends with the rescuer, who basically admits that he was wrong not to protect the victim from the onset and gives him his pick-up truck which the injured boy then drives away in leaving his ""rescuer"" in the middle of the cornfield at night.  An understandable, but unsatisfying ending.  The acting could have been much better, I would have liked to have seen tears instead of attempts to generate them, but still the most moving of all four segments.""Bumping Heads"" tells the story of a 35 year old man, Craig, and his twenty something companion, Gary, who are in the emergency room of a hospital as a result of a fight Craig was involved in in a local gay bar.  Craig made the unfortunate mistake of trying to save Gary from an lecherous stranger in the back room of the bar, and gets his noggin cracked for his efforts.  The physician treating Craig assumes that the two men are lovers because of the way they treat one another, i.e., fawning, finishing one another's sentences, etc.  Turns out, Gary has a long term lover who lives on the west coast (the story taking place on the east) and had never mentioned it to Craig.  Craig makes one last effort out of many to entice Gary into a romantic relationship that fails miserably because he thinks he has convinced both himself and Gary that the two of them would be great together.  This segment, to me at least, was the least interesting and almost pointless.Finally, ""This Car Up,"" which is told quite imaginably (you have to see it for yourself), about two men who seem diametrically opposed to one another in every possible way.  Pete is a suit in a downtown office building, Adrian is a multiply-pierced bicycle messenger who have a chance encounter when Pete takes a smoke break outside his office building.  They're each smitten by the other and, in the end, find romance in form of a lingering kiss in the building's elevator.  The kind of kiss that only two straight actors (I'm willing to bet) can share; no tongues.  This is the only story that ends with the proverbial ""happy"" attached.",9
762,Boys Life 4: Four Play,"Of the four short films featured here, the best acting was in the second film entitled ""O Beautiful"" by Alan Brown, with David Clayton Rogers and Jay Gillespie actors. This film deals with gay bashing and gay teens. A contemporary issue like gay bashing is a subject matter that some would rather not face and will undoubtedly have a bias against this film prior to viewing it, due to the subject matter. ""O Beautiful"" a complicated high drama poignantly and accurately portrays gay male teenage angst, which is very traumatic and difficult to deal with especially when occurring right after the barbarous heinous act of a gay bashing.Bravo Alan, David, and Jay! This short should be extended into a full-length film and shown in high schools around the country.",8
763,Blind love,"The full version of the tape is divided into two storylines - the main events unfold in the early XX century. And in parallel in Paris of our time. Between the journalist conducting his own investigation into the life of Fanny Kaplan and the reporter begins the novel. They have their own drama with secrets, which connect them with Kaplan's diary. From these entries, the journalist learns the details of the last years of their owner's life.The screen version of the ""Fanny Kaplan"" immediately takes us to a hundred years ago.Almost blind Fanny gets acquainted with the brother of the leader of the proletariat, Dmitry Ulyanov in the sanatorium. He falls in love with a defenceless girl. At that time he was married, but for Fanny's sake he abandoned his wife and began to live with a young mistress. He tells her a lot about his brother, helps in rehabilitation for restoring vision.Once among the crowd, she sees her first love - Victor Garskiy. It was his fault for the unsuccessful terrorist attack that she assumed and spent ten years in jail. She almost goes crazy with love, despite the fact that she becomes Victor's secret mistress. However, this time Fanny is not going to lose him. He appoints her a date on August 30, 1918, at the gate of the Michelson factory, to betray her again ...By the way, in a fairly short period of time, Elena Demyanenko's drama managed to become a winner in the nomination ""Best Foreign Film"" at the International Film Festival in Christel Palace (London, UK).",6
764,This film shocked me...it was good...very good.,"I know this will upset some folks, but the 2000 version of Dr. Seuss' classic, ""How The Grinch Stole Christmas"" was an abomination. First, the entire message of the original story was lost...and was, in fact, the opposite of Seuss' story. Second, the story was all about Jim Carrey and his mugging for the camera....everything else seemed secondary. Because of this, I was terribly disappointed, as I loved the original story and the great 1966 cartoon. Because of this, I was very reticent to watch this 2018 incarnation. But, in hindsight, my fears about the latest film are mostly unfounded.Because the film is about an hour and a half long, I already realized that the story had to be padded and include some new material...this is just inevitable. However, I was surprised how much I liked this material...such as the Grinch's cute reindeer. It was very pleasant and all contributed to the story instead of distracting from it. And, as far as the story goes, it stuck pretty close to the book--even using many exact quotes from the classic tale.As far as the quality of the film goes, it's a mixed bag but mostly good. The animation was eye-popping and wonderful. It really is great on the big screen and the 3-D effects were magnificent. I also liked that they made the Grinch a hater of Christmas but NOT a hateful or evil character. He was kinder and more sweet at times....even though he hated the holiday. The only things I wasn't thrilled about were the narration by John Legend and the voicework for the Grinch himself by Benedict Cumberbatch. I had the distinct impression that BOTH were used simply because the studio could get them--not because they were appropriate for the film. Legend is apparently a nice guy...but his nice-guy voice wasn't what you'd want or expect from a narrator. The same for Cumberbatch--who DID sound very different from his usual English accented voice but still was too 'normal' a voice for a character such as the Grinch.Overall, despite my voice talent complaint, the film is a great family film...one that honors the book and 1966 film instead of ignoring it like the 2000 incarnation. Well worth seeing and amazingly heartwarming...especially at the end as well as when the Grinch is interacting with his dog and pet reindeer.",8
765,"OK, but feels unnecessary","Took the grandkids to this movie...they didn't think it was very good. It seems like something that was produced for the dollars it could make rather than a story that needed to be told.The good: it was not very long. The colors are brilliant and visually stimulating. Max was remade with a little more of a fun personality.The bad: Grinch somehow seemed wrong. I'm not sure if it was the voice, the artistic effects, or just a general un-Grinchiness. The story was a retelling that didn't need to be. The biggest negative is the feeling that this movie is forgettable.I'm sure I'll never watch it again. I've watched the original about a billion times, and the Jim Carrey version nearly the same.Bottom line...save your money and rent it later.",4
766,Neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug,"Part of me was interested in seeing 'The Grinch', being a fan of the original Dr Seuss story and especially the 1966 animated version with Boris Karloff voicing Grinch (do like the Jim Carrey version better than most) and being someone who likes Benedict Cumberbatch and a lot of what he's done. Was nervous though too because the trailer did not look good, the reviews are mixed to not great and did question whether it was necessary.Dr Seuss adaptations have been very hit and miss. The animated short television specials have fared significantly better than the feature films, Dr Seuss' work lends itself better to adaptations of a short length and the television specials were not only great adaptations and true in detail and spirit but great on their own. Of the feature films, the best one is by far 'Horton Hears a Who' with the worst being the live action 'The Cat in the Hat' (to me among the worst films ever made). Illumination has also been variable, loved the first two 'Despicable Me' films while not caring for 'Minions'.Saw 'The Grinch' anyway as someone trying to see and review as many 2018 films as possible and loving the story and Christmas films, also to see how Cumberbatch would fare as Grinch. Seeing it, it is nowhere near as good as the 1966 version and is neither a Christmas cracker or a bah humbug. It is also neither among the best or worst films of the year, somewhere in the middle for me.There are definitely great things here. The animation cannot be faulted, so much gorgeous and meticulous attention to detail and rich vibrant colours that really immerses one into the world of Whoville. Some of the soundtrack has a festive and infectious feel. There are funny and emotional moments, the former with the funny and adorable (plus more interesting) Max and the latter with the Cindy Lou subplot, that and the character herself being the sweet and charming heart of the film.It is not a film without soul, having a warm glow more than once and some spirited elaborate set pieces, it does well with sticking to the spirit of the story and with the back and forth between Mount Crumpet and Whoville. It is not too long and has a lively pace generally. As said, Max and Cindy Lou are the best characters. Mostly the voice acting is good, with Cameron Seely being the clear standout.Having said all of this, 'The Grinch' could have been better. It does offer very little new or fresh, trying to be faithful to the source material while not moving enough beyond that that it all feels too safe. It could have done with more humour and heart generally, could have done without the repetitive and tired screaming goat gag and outside of the Cindy Lou subplot soul is missing.Found myself mixed on the pretty unrecognisable Cumberbatch. He does well providing a curmudgeonly touch and has moments of grinchy- meanness, plaudits too for not making Grinch too scary or resorting to excessive mugging. Do feel though that he was not mean or Grinchy-enough and he would have fared much better using his own voice for the character which would have fitted better. Had a big issue with the annoying, intrusive and over-explanatory narration that was not always necessary and with a rather out of place Pharrell Williams. Other parts of the soundtrack grated and too reminiscent of commercial music neither catchy or to my taste that didn't gel with the setting or the rest of the film. Too many of the supporting characters are forgettable and one-dimensional.Overall, better than what the critics have generally said but was rather mixed on a film with a lot of great merits but feels too safe and one does question the point of it. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6
767,More or less EXACTLY what one would expect from Illumination's The Grinch.,"Illumination is a studio known for producing gutless, boring, paint-by-numbers, mass appeal movies that focus more on cute gimmicks and marketing than they do on actual storytelling and character development. If you've seen anything else from Illumination, you practically don't need to see this movie, because you can probably just predict every scene in your head and just about get it right. While The Grinch isn't Illumination's worst, it's still a thoughtless and emotionless product only meant to sell toys and theater tickets before charm and charisma.Benedict Cumberbatch's Grinch is boring. I do like Cumberbatch and I did think he'd be great to voice the Grinch, but he's terrible in this movie. His voice doesn't match the character whatsoever, and does nothing to bring the character more to life. At least Jim Carrey put energy and emotion into his performance, whereas Cumberbatch sounds like he's disappointed about the small paycheck he's just been given. The Grinch himself is written in a way that pulls all punches and has to cave in to cutesy kids logic instead of a clever way that tells a good story. Instead of making The Grinch actually funny or interesting, they make him the typical 2018 grumpy hipster who's a good guy at heart but just needs his morning coffee. Making him a mostly good character really undermines the climactic payoff of him finally understanding the meaning Christmas towards the end.Sadly, both the character and the overall movie as a whole share the same problems; it's boring, uninspired, and vanilla. Much like the character, the movie sucks out anything interesting in favor for playing it safe and selling toys. The music is even done by rapper Tyler The Creator, and even as a moderate fan of his work, the music here is terribly uninspired and obviously an attempt to make the film more hip. Most of the jokes are entirely predictable. Actually, the entire movie is predictable. I don't mean we've seen the original movies, I mean the film follows every generic story you'll ever see in a kids movie. The film feels more like it was written by a computer and less like a team of engrossed screenwriters. One of the film's running gags is the ex-popular 'screaming goat' meme...seriously, I thought that meme stopped being funny in 2013.Truthfully, this film is not the worst thing to come out of Illumination. It may not be a good movie, but at least it doesn't completely bastardize and miseducate its message like The Lorax did, and at least it isn't as excruciatingly for-the-masses as Minions or The Secret Life Of Pets. The Grinch, as well as every single other Illumination Studios movie, is like a cute untamed puppy; it may urinate on your rug and chew up all of your shoes, but it's cute and looks at you with big puppy dog eyes and does silly things, so you don't punish it and let it slide when it really shouldn't be forgiven so easily. When are we as an audience going to stop letting these thoughtless movies slide solely because of their cuteness? Regardless, moms and kids alike will continue to enjoy these movies without the slightest care, simply because it's cute and nothing more.",4
768,A kinder gentler Grinch?,"Boris Karloff was the voice of the original animated Grinch of 1966, and although he wasn't scary even when I was eight, the Karloff voice brought gravity to the
proceedings. The Grinch in this film has the harmless sounding voice of Benedict Cumberbatch. And although the original Grinch was a grouch, this Grinch is nothing more than dissatisfied. I realize that the Grinch can't go around abusing his dog Max like he did in the original - times have changed. But here he is practically the dog's life coach, telling Max that he can do things if only he believes in himself.But one thing that didn't NEED to change was having Cindy Lou Who be the oldest child of an overworked single mother, Betty Lou Who. How can Cindy Lou be the smallest who in Whoville if she is an older sister? But I digress. Cindy Lou Who has just one wish - for her mother to have it easier and not be so overworked. As for the technical details, the art design tries to be too CGI. I liked the basic Chuck Jones illustrations in the 1966 version that were not meant to look the least bit real. So like most modern films, this one makes the art design photorealistic and completely misses the point of the original tale or at least throws in so many modern subplots that there is no nostalgia or charm for fans of the original.",2
769,Very Colorful,"I watched this with my grandson. Yes, I still think the original cartoon based on the book is superior. There is a simplicity that really works. The Grinch is downright mean. I love Benedict Cumberbach, but found his voice just too soothing to pull off our guy. There was too much psychological mumbo jumbo as the writers came up with an excuse for the Grinch being the way he was. Of course, it was his childhood. The movie is spectacular in its visuals. There are colorful scenes and excellent structures, making Whoville really magnificent. But the story is watered down and using Cindy Lou Who as an active character didn't work for me.",6
770,Excellent!,"There is a reason I don't read critic reviews, and it is because I never ever agree with them. Usually when they say a movie is bad, I like it and vice versa. I like to leave reviews for movies and tv shows because I enjoy them, and I don't care about other people's views. I will give you my honest review as just a regular movie lover. Glad I didn't listen to critics on this film. It was great! A sold out theater. Kids and adults all laughed throughout the film. I went with my husband, sister, brother in law, and my niece and nephew. We all loved it equally. I enjoyed Jim Carey's version but I cannot compare them. I was wondering if I could like this without it having Jim Carey but I truly did. Heart-warming film with a slightly different take on it from the last film. To me, the dog, MAX stole the show! Great animation and effects. 3D is even better. To the people saying there was no storyline...ummm, there was! sheesh. Its about...well...THE GRINCH!! You don't take my advice, its just MY opinion, but I advise everyone to see this. Do not expect an Emmy winner, but it is still a great, warm and cozy holiday film.",10
771,The Grinch: All Rapped Up,"The technicals of this version are outstanding, great, bright animation, very Pixar-ish. However, it fails in its heart which is always driven by actors' voicing and what a BIG FAIL this was - as many others have noted, so you know it's not just a few of us. First, WTH is Pharrell narrating?! Weakest voicing ever! NOTHING even approaching the dramatic storytelling of the classic's Karloff. And his hip-hop, rap interludes were simply wrong for this feature - maybe if you're setting the story in a rundown urban environment, maybe then it'd have fit, but it was totally out of place here. Then Benedict Cucumber-patch's voicing of our main Grinch character was way off base, nowhere up to the task, it was a pathetic reading of the script, the biggest letdown you could imagine. Finally, the naive, demure Cindy Lou Who from the classic is re-imagined as a hyper-active grrl power character which is also annoying and out of place. We can only hope this version is relegated to the dust bin of some Hollywood warehouse, never to be seen again.",3
772,Did they even sing the song?,"When the movie ended, I looked over at my family and asked ""did they even sing the grinch song?"" which I was highly anticipating with a fun, new modern edge. my nephew responded with ""it was a remix and not the whole song"" what?! Jim Carey made an entire scene out of it! This movie was a let down. Can they stop remaking movies if they're going to be lazy and unoriginal about it? The Jim Carey one and the original Grinch are way better than this",2
773,Beautiful looking and charming animated feature.,"I'm going to keep this review short since you know the story most likely.I was enchanted by this movie from the moment it started. It was a fun animated movie, with gorgeous animation, a lot of heart, and even some humor. The 90 minute run-time makes the movie fly by.And the Grinch is evil but not scary. This has been ridiculed, but I like that the movie was trying to make it more comfortable for the little ones.The ending, even though I knew it was coming, was very uplifting. The Grinch's heart grew 3 times bigger, but guess what? So did mine!This is one of my favorite animated movies now, and my #1 Dr. Suess adaptation. This is the movie to see this holiday season!Note: If you found this review helpful, please click on cinephile-27690 to read my other reviews!",10
774,"One word, LAME","This is another film by illumination animation, a company known for their very cheap animation, generic cookie cutter plots, low brow humor, Pop music, and those annoying minions. Yet despite this list of grievances they are highly successful, because they make lowest common denominator movies anyone between 1 month and 100 years old could watch.This brings us to the Grinch, a needless remake that no one asked for or wanted. After the Lorax's dreadful adaptation, the quality of this trash should come as no surprise. Yet it represents almost everything wrong with entertainment; it doesn't exist because an artist was inspired to craft a loving adaptation telling a story he/she wanted to tell. It exists because it's a Dr. Seuss property and a Dr. Seuss movie prints the money itself.Anyway this movie is as lame and as generic as you could possibly imagine. The Grinch is comically sympathetic, but isn't likeable. I'm stunned that the filmmakers managed to suck out all character, nuance, and personality of the Grinch and leave him as a hollow shell who acts like an A**hole. Also the Grinch who should be a foul/gross weirdo looks too clean and basic thanks to the simplicity of the cheap animation.The townsfolk are either comically evil, ignorant, or innocent. The setting is awful and feels empty, the music sucks, and the pop music REALLY makes your ears bleed in this one folks!One positive is the color pallet, very Christmas-y and very easy on the eyes. But again the animation is so basic and simplistic that each character looks so bland and unmemorable I can't even remember more than 4 character designs.Ultimately the quality doesn't matter (the studio knows this, which is why they sold this movie out to any company that would advertise it), people will see this and it'll make over $500 million at least. If somehow you like illumination animation movies, you'll like this one. if you don't then you'll hate this.",1
775,The Grinch,Dr Seuss short story of The Grinch gets a second big screen treatment.There was a very good short animated cartoon made in 1966 where the Grinch was voiced by Boris Karloff.This CGI animated version is colourful but bland. The songs have been updated by they come across as mediocre. The voice acting is below par. Benedict Cumberbatch does not come anywhere near Jim Carrey never mind Karloff.Here the Grinch hates Christmas because as a child he was always lonely at Christmas. Forced to go into Whoville during the run up to Christmas to stock up on food. The Grinch sees consumerism gone rampant over the festive period. Everything is bigger including the Christmas tree and there is forced jollity.The Grinch has a twisted idea to ruin everyone's Christmas. One girl Cindy-Lou wants to speak to Santa as she has a special wish. Maybe she can make the Grinch's heart two sizes bigger.Obviously the kids will enjoy this overlong movie. It lacks the wicked fun and zest of the 1966 cartoon.,4
776,Don't listen to the grinches reviewing this movie!,"Anyone who gave this a bad rating clearly is just upset because, they don't like a modern Grinch because they grew up with the original classic Grinch cartoon. This movie was one of the most adorable and fun feel-good animated movies I've seen in a long time. Benedict Cumberbatch killed it as the Grinch and, all the gadgets and grandeur of the grinches holiday heist scene is so creative and colourful and fantastical! This is one of the greatest Christmas movies of all time up there with Nightmare before Christmas. This movie was a joy to watch and if you couldn't find joy in this movie maybe, you're the Grinch.",9
777,I didn't like this movie. That means I'm wrong for not liking it???,"I honestly do not get the impressionable casuals who say that any critic who dislikes a movie they like is wrong. Using that logic, YOU'RE wrong for liking it. But that's not true, because it's all subjective. With that out of the way, allow me to explain why I didn't like this movie:It's dull and boring. It's not interesting, it's only funny in certain places and even then it only resulted in a small smile. If what's advertised to me as a comedy movie isn't that funny to me, I think it's failed as a movie. This could've had the potential to be a pretty decent movie and it's not the first time Illumination has done a Dr Seuss movie. Expectations weren't exactly through the roof, but I expected them to do so much better than this. The animation is pretty good, as expected for Illumination, but it can only dazzle me for about 5 minutes before I realise how dull and uninteresting this movie is.Again, if you liked this then good for you, but I just can't enjoy this movie.",5
778,Beautiful Christmas movie,Look I'm probably not the target audience for this movie but I gotta say I smiled I. Laughed I felt flat out joy one of the best of the year simple sweet and fall down funny for once instead of a movie being about war it was about peice and love and joy nothing I regret about seeing this movie,10
779,"Don't waste your time on this one, just watch the original","The thing about a remake is that there needs to be a reason to make it. When remakes have no reason to exist (other than to make a quick buck or millions of them), they fall flat, usually due to a lack effort. And therein lies the issue plaguing this 2018 version of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic about the mean-green-grumpy Grinch-it's a dull final product that likely resulting from a lack of effort. We know the Grinch stole Christmas, but who stole this movie's creativity?Just about everyone knows the classic Grinch story, but this one is a little bit different, so let's run through it. There's cheery, wintery town called Whoville filled with many delightful people called Whos. The Whos love Christmas, and they know how to celebrate the holiday right. They don't just deck the halls, they deck out the entire town with decorations, lights and a mountain-sized tree. It's all glorious.One young Who named Cindy-Lou (Cameron Seely) has an adventurous spirit and a kind heart, as central figures tend to have in these sorts of movies. She feels for her exhausted single mom who struggles to balance her time at work and at home taking care of Cindy-Lou and the twin boys. So, Cindy-Lou decides to ask Santa to help her mom by doing... something. Exactly what help Santa would provide is unclear, which makes any resolution problematic because we can't recognize the help if it arrives. If you think I'm overanalyzing this movie aimed at children, you're probably right.Any Who... living in the giant mountain adjacent to Whoville is The Grinch (Benedict Cumberbatch). The Grinch I remember as a child was a ruthless and nasty figure. Establishing him this way early on is crucial because it sets up a redemption story. This new Grinch starts off mildly rude at his worst and genuinely considerate at his best. A few half-hearted attempts to display his wickedness that fail and instead make him appear funny. The rest of the time, The Grinch is mostly pleasant. This robs viewers of the need to root for him to change because he's a decent guy the entire time. He politely interacts with an overly-jolly old friend, Mr. Bricklebaum, voiced by Kenan Thompson, who is doing some variation of his SNL character, neighbor Willie. Thompson's jubilance is good for a few laughs, the only ones you'll find in the movie. Despite his best efforts, his limited screen time doesn't afford him enough opportunity to earn this movie an overall label of ""funny.""The rest of the attempts at humor are comprised mostly of cutaways that play like watered down versions of ones you'd see on Family Guy. There's also a dusting of lazy Who-based puns, like the inclusion a place called Who Foods, a play on Whole Foods. Like the rest of the movie, the jokes clearly were made with little effort.There isn't much else to say. This is a pointless remake that doesn't need to exist. A remake that has a reason to exist should provide a fresh voice while simultaneously honoring the past creation. This film does neither. If you want to watch a story about The Grinch, you'd be much better off revisiting the original cartoon classic or the more recent live-action iteration starring Jim Carrey.",3
780,I am more bored then mister Grinch.,"I don't know what to say, really. Uninspiring? Second-tier? First of all Narrator voice, sometimes very decent, than some time you know THIS notes get slip. But its not bad like boooooooring voice acting of Benedict Cumberbatch (he don't killed AS the Grinch - he JUST killed Grinch). Why? Just why?! I know its always obvious cash-grab when in title we have THE GRINCH, like THE ONLY THING YOU CAN FIND IN GOOGLE FIRST PAGES and all sorts of Netflix-amazone-prime catalogs. I am not very amazed by Jim Carrey Grinch, but boy he in live flesh more Grinch then Cumberbatch in animation. It so lazy acting, just WOW you even don't have a little shame, guys from Illumination.",1
781,"Wrong voice, the most friendly Grinch I have ever seen","They picked the absolute worst voice for the Grinch. Also the Grinch didn't even seem bad. In fact, its like a five year old would have considered this movie less than a G rating. The Grinch is known to have a hard stare and grin with a rough voice. They ruined this version.",1
782,Maybe Christmas perhaps means a little bit more. Lost it's message!,I just didn't like it. I love the book I read it from November onwards every year to my kids. I love both the older versions but this just got diluted down until it was a poor version of a Christmas movie. The odd funny moments but nothing else. There was nothing mean or awful about the grinch at all he was quite nice to begin with just a lonely sad man who needed friends,2
783,Very disappointed,Worst adaptation of the grinch ever made. Stick to what you know and what people love....the original cartoon. Too much overacting.,1
784,My favorite version!!,"No matter how much worse the IMDb rating gets, watch the movie for yourself. I love the music, the animation, the voice talents and the storyline! Aside from from having a few goofy moments, the movie was a lot more dramatic and touching.",10
785,Christmas fun for the whole family!,"If you don't like Illumination movies, or Minion type movies, you probably won't like this version of The Grinch. Personally, I am not a fan of the original TV special, so I was dreading being dragged along to see this with the family, but I really liked it.It's a very modern take on the classic Dr. Seuss story. The plot line is basically the same, but the humor is a little different and it does play more for laughs.Personally, I prefer this one - my kids said they liked it equally with the original Grinch special.Unlike another reviewer who gave this a 1/10 and said Illumination animation was basic, I don't think it is at all. I think it is crisp and modern, and in comparison to the original, much softer and more likeable, but that's just me.I thought Benedict Cumberbatch was a weird choice for the main character's voice, but on seeing the movie, he was perfect of it.Go into this without any pre-judgment, unlike me, and you're sure to be highly entertained for around 90 minutes.I expected it to be terrible, but it will be a future Christmas favorite for our family!",10
786,"Not Grinchy enough, just depressed","Please don't see this movie in theatres, if you liked the prior Grinch movies, then you won't like this one. It's not mean, it's not funny, it's not accurate to the storyline. It also ruins the iconic grinch song. This isn't a very good movie and you shouldn't waste your money seeing this. Rewatch the Ron Howard and Jim Carey version over and over again to get your fix this year. I know that's what I'm going to do. So many better songs in that version as well.",4
787,The Grinch,"A perfect example of everything wrong with the culture of the late 2010's. The kids were cute, but that's about it.",3
788,Wasnt even grinchy,I love the actors I. It. The dog was cute. And funny moments. But the two previous grinch movies made the grinch clearly hate....loath entirely tye holiday. Where as this one made it feel like he was just avoiding. Doing his taxes. He mingled with the whos in a way that didnt even make him seem like that much of out cast. But the fault was in the writing. But still. A screaming goat is worth 8 stars lol,8
789,amazing,"Amazing, only for theaters. Realistic. You may think, it must has been that way. Rigorous, something unusual in historical movies. If you look for Hollywood here, wrong place. I do love Hollywood, anyway. Something odd: no or little music. The sound of the wind among the stones, the valleys, the mountains and the towns, animals, soldiers, people, nature and guns is the perfect soundtrack in this case. Main character is such intense: his mission is always in his eyes, always fighting, always angry, always tense. You would not say this movie comes from a third world country. I suggest a five minutes research on wiki about this fairly unknown episode of South American History. Open your mind, it is different, but good cinema.",10
790,Average Joe of a film,"Had some potential but I feel like they didn't know which cliche path they wanted this film to take.. also with as much focus and screen time the ""14 year-old boy"" receives they could've found a muchore talented actor. I'm sorry the kid was terrible.",4
791,Potential Unrealized,"With the two lead actors and the premise of this film, it could have been so much more. Unfortunately the film mirrors the acting of the central character portrayed by Julian Feder. Here is a meaty role with a meaningful journey, but the film falls flat, as does Feder's performance, or should we say lack thereof. Young man's search for father, part road trip, part billiards competition. We can't pull for the son because he takes us no where, emotionally. We really can't cheer for him in the pool competition either, because the characterization is so distant and vapid. The elements are all present, but neither the performance by the young protagonist (who does NOT look 14 y.o.) or the direction, allow us to get there. Too bad, but not memorable in the least.",6
792,"One of the worst ""pool"" movies ever.",As someone who plays pool this movie was incredibly unrealistic. If you are going to do a movie revolved around the game of pool you should know the rules of the game. And Julian Feder is just a terrible actor. Some of his scenes were painful to watch. He should focus on a new career.,3
793,Boring and bad acting,This movie was extremely boring. Their was zero excitement The boy actor is terrible and should find another career.,2

795,Your 'Average Joe' with a Couple of Good Cards in its Deck,"It's an early May morning, the sun is shining and a new Jeffrey Dean Morgan movie is peeking at me, and I say, why not. First full feature directed by veteran actor Tom Wright, written by Michael Milillo, starring David Strathairn and Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the strong supportives, and with the yet unknown Julian Feder in the lead role, ""Walkaway Joe"", quite misleadingly labeled an ""action"" movie on IMDb (as of May 8th), is an on-the-road drama about fathers, sons, mistakes and legacies. And a bit about pool.In just ten minutes we learn enough about the life of young, 14-year old Dallas McCarthy (Julian Feder), how he enjoys dominating the local bar's pool tables with his dad Cal (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), and is blind to the fact that he has a playmate instead of a father, unaware of his faults and mistakes. Dallas idolizes his dad and hopes to go in his footsteps to become a back door pool player. Dallas's mother (Julie Ann Emery), the only person displaying sense, tries her best but in vain, for nor the son, nor father listens to her. At the end of these ten minutes, Jeffrey Dean Morgan abandons both the father and husband duties and also the screen, to return about half an hour later. All in all, I was under the wrong impression of him having a much bigger role. Oh, well. Dallas throws a couple things in the backpack and climbs on his bicycle to go and find the old-man at a pool tournament up in Baton Rouge, in a local joint called ""Fatty's"". On the way, after he understands how stupid of a decision it was to cycle cross the country, he gets picked up by none other than Joe Haley, nicely performed by acting-highlight-holding David Strathairn, whom, yeah you probably guessed it, will provide a sort of a father figure. There's more than one ""Walkaway Joe"" around here.The first ever produced script by Michael Milillo offers an earnest and reflective story, but also a highly formulaic one. The philosophy, lessons and thoughts on display here as sincere and right-minded as they are old, and it all weaves together in ways so familiar and predictable. Some elements, like the danger of cash hungry the debt collectors after Cal, came off more oddly amusing than effective or menacing. A lot more menace in the faces of David and Jeffrey. Practically every plot turn can be smelled before it turns the corner, even the big, obviously incoming pool game went exactly as I thought it will. Pretty cool to watch it happening though. But, if not for the subtly amazing performances by David Strathairn and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, there wouldn't be a whole lot to get attracted to. Morgan does what he's real good at, portraying a tough guy with just enough heart to love him, and Strathairn carries the story of Joe entirely on his shoulders, offering us an authentic and content little performance. During the movies first half, I didn't know what to think of Julian Feder and his naive, hotheaded character on the road to the inevitable and unsurprising redemption. It was hard to grow to like Dallas, and the performance carrying him is not one I call great. He also didn't look 14 at all, so I was pretty shocked to find out he actually was 14 at the time of filming...The cinematography is of the standard kind, options for realism as much as possible, nothing is neither extraordinary or over-the-top. Well shot pool scenes, though it's also possible I haven't seen enough of those. As its befitting for such an Americana tale, the soundtrack goes full country, but not to any faults.""Walkaway Joe"" is, pardon me for this, your average Joe. It's a movie with its head straight and intentions clear, has a couple of good cards in its deck, the most valuable of which being David Strathairn. A contemporary drama that's worth tagging along provided any of this raised your intrigue. Perhaps I enjoyed it more than that, but I say 5/10.",5
796,Worth a watch,I think this film should at least be a 8. Love the storyline and the build up of the characters right to the very end. Julian Feder who plays Dallas did an exceptional job in his role and was a real stand out. Watch it with your family and support this film!,8
797,Much potential but more hit and miss,"I have enormous respect for both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and David Strathairn and this is a movie about the relationship between boys and their fathers. How could this go wrong in any way? Well, unexplainably, it did.While the story in the film is charming, it is also completely predictable and barren of any subtlety. A big minus was the lead actor, Julian Feder, who had the emotional range of a two by four, while at the same time having no other positive attributes. I mean, his character was not a meathead muscleman who didn't need to show emotion, only punch people, he was a goofy fourteen year old who was trying to get his asshold father to come back to his family. The actor should have gone from crying his eyes out to smashing things and through cold hearted mean spirited and thoughtless words. He only managed the latter.And this film had so much potential. Strathairn also went with a subdued, more cerebral take, while Jeff Morgan was awesome in how well he portrayed the worthless pool hustler. I mean, even his posture was completely different from his usual roles. Unfortunately he had only a few scenes and that was all. His mother should have had a bigger role, too. I actually like Julie Ann Emery a lot, too, but she had like four scenes in the whole thing. I mean, this could have been another Over the Top. I know that wasn't the greatest movie of all times, but it stayed with me. Unfortunately Walkaway Joe rises very little over day TV film quality and I will not remember it. Too bad.",6
798,Good but incomplete script.,"Midwest. Pool shark father (Morgan) runs out on family. 14 year old son (who looks 25) goes after him and immediately meets Joe (Strathairn). Both butt heads but go on the journey together.Good but incomplete script. Moved well. Good acting except from the kid who badly mumbled most of his lines and really didn't look the part. A few plot holes.You had a passing sense that the Joe character had ""demons"" but still kind of came out of nowhere at the end.d but incomplete script.",7
799,Absolutely the worst road trip and dramatic film I have ever seen,"So here is the crazy and rather dumb story behind this film impressionable Dallas McCarthy wants to carry on his father's legacy and be a major player as an American pool hustler, but it seems that not all fun and games can be found here and Dallas' father is being pursued by some bad dudes. Protective father Joe Haley takes Dallas under his wing and the two begin to bond, but it seems that Joe may have something to hide and as time progresses Dallas becomes unclear about where his loyalties truly lie...In all my years of film watching I can honestly say that I have never seen a film as pointless, stupid and downright boring as Walkaway Joe in my entire life. So where do I start? Well with the whole film as in nothing happens and even when incidents do occur they are the sort of incidents that would test the patience of a saint and add no value to the film.The whole dumbass journey between the protagonists made no sense and the stupid story was just dumb beyond belief.I feel bad for Jeffrey Dean Morgan (a good actor who has been saddled with this rubbish) the film is terrible and has no redeeming features whatsoever.I'm not sure what else I can say other than avoid this rubbish it genuinely is 'craptastic'",1
800,"JOE, U COULD HAVE DONE BETTER","I was expecting a lot more from this movie. I'm a Jeffrey Dean Morgan fan and I don't feel that he lived up to his potential. Overall it's a well written story although the acting wasn't up to the screenplay.
Another story of a dysfunctional family in our country where a stranger can make a difference in a kids life. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent movie but it's not something that's outstanding or left me saying, that was a good movie, when I left the movie theater. It's worth watching, but I don't know if it should be in your top picks. 👀",6
801,Bad,I don't know who thinks that kid fit into this picture but they were very much mistaken.,3
802,The adults are some of the best character actors on the planet. So let's let this film rest on the shoulders of some kid who can't act.,"Is this kid the son of some producer or something? This film could have been something halfway decent. It isn't. I knew in the first 15 minutes this kid wasn't right for this role. He's young, and might still have a future in front of him but this was too meaty a role to rest on the shoulders of someone so inexperienced and so obviously not up to the task. He looks and sounds like someone from the Hudson Valley but I'm supposed to buy that this kid is from Louisiana? It's a good enough story, standard run of the mill father/son/mentor picture and I really like these kinds of films, but it's bogged down by a poor lead performance. I don't regret watching it as I'm a huge Morgan/Strathairn fan. Emery is a good actress as well. It's not a bad story, just something that's been done a million times before, and better. Could have benefitted from a better lead.",6
803,Good pool movie.,"Somebody mentioned that they didn't understand why all the good reviews and that they gave up halfway through. Well chances are the good reviews came from people who stuck it out till the end.
Good pool movie. I always like it when you can tell the actors are really shooting pool and they don't cut away from the actor to the shot, making you think that somebody other than the actor actually made the shot. You can tell that the actors are either decent pool players or they took the time to practice for the film.",7
804,Good movie,"I get people saying the writing might be uninspired and familiar, yet I really like these type of movies. There is something about these familiar movies that moves us, especially when the acting is good like this one. Also, the pool playing gives a little action to the drama. David Strathairn is great and Jeffey Dean Morgan is cool even though not a great father figure. I don't get why people have a problem with Julian Feder. He's a really good actor, and I've seen him in other movies, including A Boy Called Po, where he was amazing! Maybe it was the direction, as overall the movie can be a little slow. But, in the end, I would recommend the movie for the performances and message.",9
805,An Entertaining Redemption Movie,"The film wasn't rated, but I think it would probably be a PG or PG13 movie. There is some smoking, some mild violence and one or two curse words. Knowing this, I will leave it up to you, if you think appropriate for your children, but I am very comfortable with my 9 and 14 year olds watching the movie.The characters played by David Strathairn, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Julian Feder and Julie Ann Emery are all good realistic characters and are acted well. The story is about a young man and his father, who are in the middle of making some bad choices and Joe (David Strathairn) has already made his and has been suffering for years.The young man, Dallas (Julian Feder), is searching for his father, who has left him for a life on his own playing pool. Dallas is at first reluctantly helped by Joe. However, when the boy shows a kind gesture, Joe continues to help him. In some ways, Joe was like Cal (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) at a period in his life (we later learn he suffered a tragedy), but has learned and continues to learn through Dallas the importance of friendship and fatherhood. With each others help, Joe and Dallas find some redemption and peace. The Cal character leaves with issues still to be resolved. I won't give it away.I really appreciated the selflessness and mentorship expressed in the film. I was tremendously moved by the ending and hopeful for Joe. I recommend this film.",9
806,Father son relation !,"Good story about family relation, especially between father and son. Beginning part is dull and slow but it grips you later till end with depth of emotions and with touching end. A home run away son meets a desepred father at pool centre. Initially they dislike each other but gradually a healthy father-son relation is developed then and it is much deeper and stronger than real father son relation. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Cal) plays here a careless father's role but most important role by David Strathairn (Joe) is the highlighted part of the movie. He steal the show and many his scenes give tears in your eyes and you will surely admire him for a ideal father. Julian Feder ( Dallas) is also did good job in son's role. End is very touching and takes you on the height of emotions. Good story, good photography, good acting and perfect for family. Must watch.",8
807,Bad movie,"I love and support Jeffrey Dean Morgan but this movie it's bad and no because him , he did an excellent job for the short time in screen but the movie is very slowly and boring",1
808,Great family movie,"It starts a bit slow but soon enough Dallas is able to warm our hearts and give the meaningful point across. Really Good acting, music and scenery. It is suitable for the whole family specially during lenghty stay at home advisory !!!",9
809,Beautiful film-Suitable for the Entire Family to Watch Together!,"I loved this movie! It is a great story filled with rich, complex characters. The acting performances by Jefferey Dean Morgan and David Strathairn were superb. The young, talented Julian Feder was equally impressive, holding his own alongside Strathairn and Morgan with an outstanding, understated perfomance.
I also appreciate that this is a movie you can watch with the entire family-a great thing now that so many of us are at home with our families.",10
810,Below average,The pool scenes were good Negan actor from walking dead was poor here but not as awful as his son Dallas shocking performance,3
811,10/10,"This film was not only visually stunning but left a lasting impact through the nuanced character dynamics. With a familiar tone of a western redemption, the modern performance-driven story was family-friendly while still portraying the grit and charisma of small-town individuals in the competitive world of pool tournaments. While the action-packed games of pool at local bars can arguably be the standout aspect of the film, it is the beautiful relationships that form and fall apart along the way that make you want to watch a second time.",10
812,A Wise Film And One You Can Watch With The Entire Family,"This is one I will watch again with my husband and kids. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays a father, who has left his wife and son. His son, Julian Feder, goes on the road in search of him and meets up with David Strathairn, who has made his own poor family (and paternal) choices. This young man and older father figure, work together to find his father, and learn a lot from one another.Most importantly, there are a lot of important life lessons here--compassion, self responsibility, love and strength. All the actors' performances, including the young actor Julian Feder, are very convincing and moving. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and David Stratharin deliver as usual. It was fun to see Jeffrey in this role--always enjoy seeing a man's man.This is one where I think everyone will be able to identify on some level as a parent and child. Given this, it is a timeless story, which could've played the same years ago and will be as meaningful years from now. I anticipate that our entire family will go play pool after watching this one.",9
813,Brutal,"The pool scenes are choreographed so poorly that even someone who has zero understanding of the game would have to be disappointed. If you are going to make a movie around a particular sport, enthusiasts of that sport will naturally take a look. With that in mind surely you would endeavour to impress that audience somewhat. It fails miserably by falling back on obvious worn out pool cliches. That aside, the acting is terrible. And the movie is irretrievable from there.",1
814,A Great Film.,"Don't be swayed by the negative reviews. I knew nothing about this film before I watched it. Afterward I thought it had been nominated for a bunch of awards. I can't believe it didn't get any nominations, and even got negative reviews from some critics. I'm not sure if this one makes it into my top 10 for the year, but it's definitely in my top 20.Sure, the subject matter has been covered before, but that shouldn't matter. So has divorce, bank robberies, and most recently, the death of a child. Just because a subject has been covered before in a film doesn't mean the film should be dismissed.I thought this movie was way better than Rabbit Hole. While Rabbit Hole gets all the recognition, Frankie and Alice gets ignored. I'm not even any sort of huge Halle Berry fanatic. I just know a good movie when I see one and it makes me angry when good films are ignored.",9
815,A Lone Time Coming,"I find it hard to believe that this film could not find a distributor and stayed in a holding cell for four years. Multiple personality films have always done well (The Three Faces of Eve, Sybil) and have garnered the lead actresses in both an academy award. Halle Berry (Frankie) was outstanding in channeling the other personalities trapped inside her head. As with all split personality films there is always some tragic event that occurs in the early years of life that fosters personalities to protect the host. This film was set in the 1970s and I have to say the wardrobe and locations were pretty accurate (from what I can remember). I even found myself singing along with some of the music. The fact that a straight-jacket and hypnosis was going to be involved was a no-brainer. The constant flashbacks also did not come as a surprise, but I think that the way that Halle managed those scenes is what made them memorable. Stellan Skarsgard (Oz) is the physician who takes a personal interest in Frankie's case and is responsible for getting to the heart of the issues. Phylicia Rashad (Edna) and Chandra Wilson (Maxine) are Frankie's mother and sister who are either in denial or assisting in a cover-up, or both. It was refreshing to see a film that wasn't tethered with CGI. It's kind of rare these days. Do I think that this film could have been shown on Lifetime., sure, but I'm glad that it wasn't. The reason why is because anytime you can get a film on the big screen that contains a decent amount of diversity of actors (that isn't about slavery or servitude) then I'm all for it (I'll get off my soapbox now). The story held my attention and there were no areas of lag time. Of course I was trying to figure out what caused the personality split from the beginning. I have to say that this one kept me guessing until the end. I think that knowing that this is a true story adds to the appeal of the film and I was thrilled that the film explained what happened to the actual people at the end. I asked a few people after the movie, what they thought of the film and they all pretty much said the same thing; they liked the film, but it wasn't what they were expecting. I concur.",7
816,outstanding!!!,"A great film and great acting in both lead roles. Must say halle berry is simply great!!! give this a watch and be surprised!!! I have no idea why this never won any awards. Its nothing like the film Sybil, that everyone thinks about when it comes to MPD.",10
817,FRANKIE'S NOT HERE,"Frankie is a stripper in Watts with multiple personality disorder. One can't help think about ""The Three Faces of Eve"" (unless you've never seen it) while watching this film. The audience is subjected to Frankie's disorder in the first five minutes and quickly escalates until she is in therapy with Dr. Osgood (Stellan Skarsgård). At this point the film becomes a mystery as to the event which triggered the disorder.The film is based on a true story and is gritty at times. It is a straight forward drama without any twists and a hint of mystery. Halle Berry did an excellent job.Parental Guide: Infrequent F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",10
818,Don't listen to the critics on this one the only thing similar to Sybil was the mental disorder.,"Well i had heard little and nothing about this flick and only finding out about it after i saw that Halle Berry was nominated for a golden globe and reading the review and synopsis to this hidden away little flick and found out it was a true life case of a woman with split personality disorder. Halle plays a stripper named Frankie whose little mood swings have all but frightened the crap out of her coworkers and boss. It turns out these mood swings are a lot more serious and turn out to be s.p.d. Frankie has two others sharing her tired little body, one a frightened but smart as a whip 9yr old girl who her psychiatrist Dr. Oz (Stellan Skarsgard) names genius and an racist white woman named Alice. As the movie rolls along we find out that their is a lot of history that inspired Frankie to take on these alter persona's and can be triggered by something as simple as a song on the radio. An overall good film that lot of reviewers and critics have been calling a Sybil rip off ( I don't call it that but the mental illness is the same thats for sure) Berry's nomination for the golden globe failed and wasn't won as it went to Natalie Portman's performance in Black Swan (another acting job that was well deserved of the win) however she once again pulled off a solid job along with a stellar performance in this film.",6
819,A Chix Chat on Film review: Split Personality,"I did not realize that Frankie and Alice was a 2010 film until I looked it up at IMDb. Although, I did notice while viewing the film that Halle looked incredible and youthful as the lead character in the title role of Frankie. This is the second time that Ms. Berry has been on screen as an exotic dancer, she was less memorable in that short lived role in The Last Boyscout. Frankie Murdock (Halle Berry) comes across as someone who knows what she has to do to survive her circumstances how to pick a mark to get paid and even hands out vocational advice to coworkers. We find out however, through her erratic behavior it is revealed that she is not as well put together as she first seems. I knew from the trailer that the film dealt with multiple personality disorder or whatever is the current clinical name for split personalities, so the film The Three Faces of Eve came to mind as I attentively watched the story unfold. Through a series of flashbacks we see Frankie as a child and a young woman and eventually learn and understand the root of her mental illness as she undergoes treatment with Dr. Oz (Stellan Skarsgard). I would love to see Mr. Skarsgard step outside of his character, he has this Zoolander approach to acting, no matter what persona he is portraying it's always the same look. Ms. Berry on the other hand was on point she was emotionally engaging, showing a range that was both compelling and evoked compassion for what her character had endured. Her personality was splintered; her experiences caused her coping mechanisms into overdrive. Halle Berry proves that the title of 'Oscar winner' is well deserved. She played the role very convincingly with Oz and against the other key characters in the film her mother Edna (Phylicia Rashad) and her sister Maxine (Miranda Bailey oops, I mean Chandra Wilson). I enjoyed this story because it was interesting and not a new construct, it was nice to see the bad guy in the usual places, but to find a completely unexpected bad guy in this film was bittersweet. The first half hour or so became a bit annoying with all the jumping around, but not enough to reduce the entertainment value.",6
820,The Three Faces of Frankie - Berry's Best Role To Date,"Serious films in which a lead actor portrays someone suffering with mental illness walk a precarious tightrope, navigating a delicate balance between authenticity and parody. In ""Frankie and Alice,"" Halle Berry gracefully succeeds in this high wire act, making not 2 but 3 transformations before your very eyes - between a fiery stripper, a coldly calculating status climber and an innocent child. It is a performance that deserves attention and accolades above and beyond Berry's controversial yet ultimately inferior performance in ""Monster's Ball"" for which she made history by being the first African American to win the industry's highly coveted Best Actress Oscar.""Frankie and Alice"" opens setting the scene as 1973 with Frankie working as a ""stripper"" (more go-go dancer in a bird cage as she never gets naked). A botched after hours seduction with the club's DJ gives us our first hint of the madness to come. As the film proceeds, key emotional triggers spark seismic swings in Frankie's mood, hurtling her down memory lane to a series of traumas involving death, racism, young love, identity and soul-searing loss that have led her to dissociate from the pain by adopting alter personalities.Berry's believability during these on-camera transformations is near-magical - the shifts in her face, her voice and her mannerisms all specific and unerring, and without the crutches of makeup, wardrobe or special effects. The result is riveting without being distractingly dazzling. It is a performance that pulls you in at every moment yet you never pull out of your required film world state of disbelief.It is amusing to recall that this isn't the first time Berry has been called upon to play a character with multiple personalities. In the Hollywood howler ""Catwoman,"" a movie roundly considered a campy cult-relegated turkey, she got a chance to practice in a vampier all-surface showcase. In the braver independent film ""Frankie and Alice,"" Halle takes the lessons scratched out of ""Catwoman"" and chisels a performance of far greater subtlety, depth and compassion.The supporting cast is excellent, particularly Stellan Skarsgard as the sympathetic ""Dr. Oz"" who with initial reluctance then heroic wholeheartedness helps Frankie heal and get to the bottom of her troubled mind. Phylicia Rashad is also praiseworthy as Frankie's mother ""Edna"" burdened with cryptic secrets and overcompensating by showering Frankie with exceeding affection - much to the distaste of her other daughter ""Maxine"" played equally well by Chandra Wilson.The writing (credited to eight people) and editing are off-kilter in places, weakening the overall grade of the film. There was clearly much hand-wringing in regard to tone and length over the decade-plus it took to get it filmed then suitably distributed. However, there are enough victorious moments that snap the film back together toward a satisfying conclusion, though you wish the story stretched a bit longer into Frankie's recovery process. Evocative musical selections from Marvin Gaye, The Everly Brothers, Kool & The Gang and The Miles Davis Quintet also provide illuminating and memorable detours along Frankie's journey. Most winningly, despite the heavy subject matter, ""Frankie and Alice"" is a crowd-pleaser dotted with tasteful scenes of lightheartedness in the face of even some of its most delicate situations.Now that Halle has, unfortunately, been passed over for Oscar consideration for ""Frankie and Alice,"" impartial audiences can settle in for a superb and sensitive cinematic portrayal, judging it squarely and with even-keel for themselves.",7
821,Excellent Portrayal,"As one who lives with Dissociative Identity Disorder, I found the film engaging, honest and true to life. I did find it interesting that Dr. Oz refers to Frankie as having Dissociative Identity Disorder--since that name for the disorder was not around in the 1970s. Halle Berry portrays someone with a mental health issue in a convincing way--and portrays the issues of living with DID very well. The movie is well written and cast. My only complaint was that there was too little time spent showing genius...who is her helping alter. I know mine was out a lot more than I was before I became aware of the alters. It took Berry years to get this project out, sadly the release even now is very limited. It would go a long way toward helping others understand this disorder.",10
822,Borderline,"Sometimes it's easy to dismiss things or take them for granted. Watching Halle Berry, the ageless one, performing here is a treat. And it's a big obstacle she has to overcome. Because she could have easily drifted into ridiculous with her portrayal. Unknowingly so, especially if the director wouldn't have noticed either.But playing it the way she does, you believe her and all the sudden changes she goes through. It helps having Stellan at her side. It's also nice to see the wife of the Cosby show in this, even in a small role like this. The movie/story itself is based on a true story, but don't be put off by that. It was a story worth being told",7
823,"If anyone EVER deserved an Oscar, it's Halle for this performance!!","First of all, let me assure you that I have absolutely no financial ties to this movie. That being said, let me tell you that I do now have a PSYCHOLOGICAL tie to this movie. By now, you know that this is a split- personality movie. Joanne Woodward won an Oscar for ""Three Faces of Eve""; Sally Field won an Emmy for ""Sybil"". HALLE BERRY IS BETTER!!! Watch her performance, and, without CGI or special effects, you'll see her change from an ""exotic dancer (ie: stripper)"", to a racist, to a little girl. You'll be sucked in to the story. Then you'll be on the edge of your seat with tears in your eyes when, at the end, the terrible crisis from her youth is starkly revealed. And yet, the written epilogue just before the closing credits is uplifting and hopeful. If EVER there was a ""must-see"" movie, THIS IS IT!!",10
824,Fear Of Miscegenation Plays The Leading Role,""" We have only one enduring weapon against mental illness, understanding our childhoods and how this has impacted us"" Alice MillerThe young African American female known as Frankie and Alice, experienced statutory rape by a white male, pregnancy and birth of a child taken away by her own mother because of the fear of miscegenation.Frankie goes into a hypnotic trance to keep the abuse a secret and knows what it feels like to be in the perpetrator's shoes. Frankie the abused becomes Alice the abuser.Halle Berre is flawless in portraying an abuse survivor who struggled with dissociation and re enactments to master the earlier trauma of having her own child taken away by being a caged stripper. At least she will have some control this time by getting paid.Frankie and Alice is caged by the seduction of the White American Dream and the glamour that prevents true intimacy.""Frankie and Alice"" is very much like the 1930 classic novel ""Native So by Richard Wright with the leading role played by the fear of miscegenation.This film is well cast and well written with characters that you can believe in. This is especially true for the psychiatrist who calmly stated that ""awareness rather than blaming leads to wholeness and integration"".It is not the trauma that makes us sick but the inability to express the trauma.",9
825,Conversion reaction,Well dramatized and acted portrayal of a person afflicted by a conversion reaction with multiple personalities. Haile Berry does a. Good job of acting.,7
826,Decent DID Flick.....,"I can't believe I had never heard of this movie that came out five years ago!??? What a find! I saw this on Netflix and added to my queue awhile back, but for some reason, had forgotten that this was one a friend had recommended to me. This is one of those little films that didn't get much attention when it came out, but surely will be used to educate about multiple personality disorder or D.I.D. (Dissociative Identity Disorder) in the future, if it's not already.Oscar winner Halle Berry gives a really interesting complex performance as the titular character(s), a go-go dancer in 1973, who after a couple run-ins with the law, ends up in a mental institute being treated by a psychoanalyst (Stellan Skarsgard), who thinks he may know what her problem is. He discovers multiple layers within the one person, and very methodically begins to put together the pieces of the puzzle that may have caused the disorder in the first place. I've seen a few other films about D.I.D. over the years, and this is one of the better ones. My only issue with this- *possible SPOILER* - is the ending. It just seemed like this movie didn't really end, it just sorta stops abruptly- and not the most satisfactory. Phylisha Rashad co-stars.",7
827,Under rated!,"This movie is very under rated and sold short by the critics. Halle Berry does a wonderful job portraying a woman with multiple personalities. 
Stellan Skarsgård turns in a great preformance as the doctor who helps her control her changing circumstances. A must watch film.",10
828,Frankie And Alice,"Frankie and Alice was a film that came out in 2010 but for some reason didn't come out until a couple of years later. If ever there were a reason to give Halle Berry another academy award, it would be for this film! Frankie and Alice is gut wrenching, soulful and sometimes painful to watch. Especially when Halle's character Frankie revisits memories of her love life. Frankie's mother played by the equally great Phylicia Rashad is a maid working for a wealthy Caucasian family and Frankie begins a love affair with the son of the wealthy family that ends in tragedy when the love of Frankie's life is killed in an auto accident. Halle's performance in Frankie and Alice is nothing short of amazing. It's a great study about the human mind as well as the psyche of a person who has gone through a tremendous amount of emotional pain and trauma. I recommend this film to anyone curious about multiple personality disorder or for anyone who has personally gone through it.",10
829,Halle Berry on her best,"I never heard of this film until I saw it in the list of the movies 2010/2011, then i saw its trailer and after that, it got nominated for Golden Globe.Berry plays a woman with Multiple personality disorder. I would say superb acting, especially how she did the different personages.I would say this movie is above average. this movie received very bad reviews from critics, I don't understand why they rate it that bad.I would say excellent incredible acting, especially how she did the different personages.I would say see the movie for your self, then draw your conclusions before putting a negative rating.",7
830,Frankie & Alice YES!,"I love this movie. It was intriguing, suspenseful, and unpredictable. One of the few films I've watched that I couldn't guess what was going to happen next.",10
831,2nd Best Performance By An Actress 2010,"While the movie itself, direction and editing, may be a little choppy at times, Halle Berry's performance is a surefire bet for a Best Actress Oscar nomination. The only better performance by an actress from a movie released in theaters during 2010 is by Jessica Chastain in and as Jolene.Sadly, both Jolene and Frankie And Alice are films released by very independent studios.As for Freestyle Releasing and Frankie And Alice, they have a great new publicist in charge of Oscar campaigns, so bet the house on one of the 5 spots in the 2011 Best Actress Oscar race to go to Halle Berry. And a Golden Globe nod too.Her performance as a multiracial character (based on a true story) with multiple personality disorder is heartbreaking, convincing and uplifting at the end.Phylicia Rashad, who plays Berry's mother in the movie, is also outstanding.As for who'll actually win the Oscar; Annette Bening, since she's a three time Oscar loser, twice to Hilary Swank, and once to Kathy Bates. Halle Berry already has a Best Actress Oscar for Monster's Ball, and while she deserves it over Bening, politics just may prove too strong for Berry to win a second this time around.",9
832,Continuing her MONSTER'S BALL trilogy of psychological mayhem . . .,". . . which progressed to GOTHIKA in 2003, America's most self-flagellating actress--Halle Berry--deftly plays another psychiatric basket case in FRANKIE & ALICE. Her latest is not a perfect movie. For one thing, it could have included more comic relief scenes of Ms. Berry in Whiteface, whistling Dixie, in order to break the occasionally uncomfortable build-ups of tension. But the Right-to-Life agenda is sandwiched so delicately into FRANKIE & ALICE that many Pro-Choicers will not even realize it's there. Ms. Berry performs most of the trademark moves her groupies love, such as sitting forlornly on the floor under a running shower clutching her shins to conceal her private parts, which she's done in at least five films now. This is definitely a ""chick flick"" (the dead give-away for this genre is that the strippers--including Ms. Berry's character here--never wear less than a bikini, and the extras playing the fake strip club customers go bananas anyway).",9
833,Halle Berry gets to do some acting,"Frankie (Halle Berry) is a stripper with multiple personality disorder in 1970s. After an incident, she seeks help from Dr. Oz (Stellan Skarsgård). She lives with her mother Edna Murdoch (Phylicia Rashad) and sister Maxine (Chandra Wilson). She is haunted by memories and forgotten traumas. She disrupts Paige Prescott's wedding and gets thrown in jail. She gets Dr. Oz to evaluate her. She starts to remember her work as the Prescotts' maid and an illicit affair with Paige's brother.This is built for Halle Berry to do some acting work but it isn't much more than that. The secret memories aren't that compelling. It becomes one acting scene from Halle to another. There is an intriguing white racist personality which digs a little deeper and is something different. The story has no drive and no tension.",4
834,Oscar worthy performance by Halle Berry,"For me this was the performance that deserved an Oscar for Ms. Berry. Her descent was believable, every character real.",9
835,Because this is a true story it makes it that much more powerful & if the pacing was a little quicker this would be great,"""Treatment is indefinite and integration is only beginning. The ultimate goal is acceptance."" Frankie (Berry) is a go-go dancer with multiple personalities who is trying to straighten out her life. When things become dangerous for her she is taken to a hospital where she meets Oz (Skarsgård), a psychotherapist who tries to help her. He meets all of her personalities and talks with each of them in order to find out Frankie's past and what caused this problem. This is based on a true story. I'll start by saying I have not seen every single movie that Halle Berry has been in but of the ones I have seen I have never been impressed with her acting. Even when she won the Oscar for Monster's Ball I didn't think she deserved it, to me all she did was get naked and cry for a few hours, that doesn't impress me. That said, if I were to give her an award it would be for this one. She plays the different personalities so convincing and different that you believe she has this problem. As for the movie itself it is very good and worth watching even though it did seem to drag a little bit. The fact that this is a true story makes it that much more powerful and if the pacing was a little quicker this would be a fantastic movie. Overall, a movie that is very good and worth seeing especially for Berry's performance. I give this a B.",7
836,One of the worst films ever made. Period.,"First off, I'd just like to make it clear that I did not find this movie terrible for any political reason. I am neither left or nor right, and I am totally indifferent to politics.Now, with that out of the way. This film is utterly awful. Aiming to be a low budget, cult classic that pokes fun at right-wing conservativeness, ""Existo"" crashes and burns with its trite political humor that completely fails at even garnering the slightest of smirks. Coke Sams (who, by the by, directed the Ernest films, which are some of the worst films of all time), is trying way too hard, and ends up with a ""beat you over the head"" style of attempted satire that completely misses the point of cult fandom.The genius of cult classics is that the directors didn't know they were making a cult classic. They just wanted to make a quirky, original film and weren't sure if anyone would like it. But Coke Sams is actually trying to intentionally make a cult classic here. He's aware of himself too much, and that makes his work extremely pretentious. It's like someone dumped the entire Criterion Collection, every episode of Inside the Actor's Studio, some of Michael Moore's 5th grade liberal poems that he scribbled on the back of his notebook, and a gallon of feces into a melting vat, mixed up the putrid contents, and then, through some undoubtedly illegal process, converted the product into a film of monumentally horrible proportions.The film opens with a voice-over that tells of a dystopian, ultra-conservative future. Yeah, really subtle. Existo, the main character of film, played by Bruce Arnston, is a member of a secret rebel movement poised to overthrow the right-wing government. Arnston does all sorts of Zaney things that you'd see on one of those live-action children's shows on PBS, like delivering all of his lines, both in dialog and song, in the fashion of a bad Jim Carrey imitation, and while this may amuse the everloving crap out a group of 8 year olds, it does naught for someone with an attention span wide enough to realize that there's about ten billion better ways they could be wasting their time, like setting all their cherished possessions on fire or phialing down grandma's bunions.No doubt through some kind of agreement between Sams and Jim Varney via their Ernest-built relationship, Varney makes his very last appearance in this film as an old man caked in Cream of Wheat. It's very sad to think that this was the last ""professional"" thing Varney did before he died, and I can't help but to think that Varney's death is somehow related to this film.I'll close by saying, don't be fooled by the positive user comments for this film. This film was made in Nashville, and you'll note that almost all of the positive user comments are from anonymous users from Tennessee, most likely friends of Sams or even members of the crew who produced this abomination, perhaps even Sams himself.",1
837,Terrible,"Congratulations, your film was so bad it actually made my feel ill to my stomach. Every single scene makes the top 10 of things that are worse than injecting boiling titanium into my thigh. If your name can be associated with this movie in any way, then i recommend you immediately tie your feet together and jump down a flight of concrete steps.I recommend you stop making movies forthright. Perhaps you can find another outlet? Maybe knitting? Restoring classic cars? I don't care. As long as there is absolutely no chance of seeing another one of your wretched movies again.",1
838,"Imaginative, funny, savage musical satire; Kudos for Bruce Arnston!","Read on, and consider the vehemence with which others have attacked EXISTO -- why, I wonder, are they so infuriated at this movie? They could have turned it off or walked out any time.First off, for those nay-sayers already posting reviews here on IMDb, the initial concentration of Tennessee-based reviews isn't reflective of filmmakers stacking the deck -- this film has been without a distributor and has only been seen at film fests and regionally, like, in Tennessee. I've seen it thanks initially to a friend who was born down south and now lives up here in the Godless north, and since worked to book it at a local film festival here in VT back in the spring.EXISTO exist-os in two versions: Coke Sams's original cut, which opens with Gailard Sartain's hilarious song ""Do Me,"" and a later (2004?) film festival slight re-edit with a whole new beginning, which provides a succinct backstory for Existo as a character and political context for the film proper, stating it as a W. Bush-era satire, though the film itself (shot in '98) predates Bush's presidency. Thus, it's pretty clear Sams, Bruce Arnston (a musical genius and satirist extraordinaire) and crew could clearly see where this country was headed before the '90s were out, and EXISTO is as timely as ever -- hence, its production was prescient more than reactionary in terms of its dystopian theocracy setting. How times change: America has become Nashville.The Nashville-based talent was indeed behind the entire ERNEST phenomenon, and in fact Existo (Arnston) was a fixture on the old Coke Sams/John Cherry produced/directed HEY VERN, IT'S ERNEST! TV series, in a less activist fetal form -- a maladroit stage illusionist, Existo the Magician (note Jackie Welch, terrific here as Maxine, was also a regular on the show, as were Sartain and others). Arnston also contributed clever musical spots to that program, as he did for at least one of the ERNEST films, and he and Welch worked again with Sams after EXISTO touring with a country-western musical comedy duo Bill & Coo, which hopefully will reach fruition in a form more folks can see.The semi-claustrophobic nature of the film is due to its being set in the underground nightclub scene Existo and Maxine return to in the opening. It's essentially a theater film, and that primary-set aspect (which again seems to be fueling some reviewers here) is apropos; as in films as diverse as THE BLUE ANGEL, CABARET, CAFE FLESH and TOPSY-TURVY, the core set IS the stage Existo performs on. Thus, apart from some key set pieces (in the posh renovated restaurant supplanting a former underground performance space, the estate Existo and Penelope retreat to, and some exteriors), it all centers around the club, a conceit some obviously chafe at though it's not reflective of low-budget paucity of imagination, it's integral to the concept and characters itself. If that's a negative for you, too bad. Theater films are, by their nature, often prescribed in their settings; this is not per se indicative of cheapness.Having spent time working theater in my college years, I can attest to the accuracy with which the film captures that insular universe, which is part of its appeal -- clearly, the filmmakers are also extrapolating from their own close-knit theatrical/video troupe. Again, despite the strong negative reviews here, there is a fine story at work -- the plot kicks in after the setup of the characters and world they live in. Every musical number (and this is a musical, as much as ROCKY HORROR, THE WICKER MAN, FORBIDDEN ZONE, etc.) is brilliantly executed, advancing characters and narrative with deft skill while being in and of themselves outstanding: brilliant, audacious, hilarious, akin to Trey Parker's abilities (though Arnston is, to my ear, by far the better musician and sharper talent; I've since snapped up the CD and love spinning it while working). To my mind, Arnston is an unsung musical genius, his entire body of work embracing (with seeming effortlessness) all idioms, genres and target audiences at one time or another, his wit quick and range astonishing. He's at the center of EXISTO, and it's his film.Seen today, EXISTO is still a pointed, funny and pretty savage snapshot of the ""Land of the Free"" since the Reagan Administration, ""Contract With (read:On) America"" anti-NEA ReBiblican era of politics kicked into full swing. Though the film's antic flamboyance deliberately undercuts any sense of mortal danger, Existo and his band of guerrilla performance artists are fighting for their lives against crushing political repression, making the film a curious companion to V FOR VENDETTA; in fact, in some ways EXISTO is closer to aspects of the original Alan Moore/David Lloyd graphic novel (created in the 1980s, reflecting Moore & Lloyd's anxiety over Thatcher's reign), retaining and expanding the music hall/cabaret element of the original V that the film adaptation ditched. Existo and his cronies, though, are less lethal compatriots, aiming to blow minds instead of Parliament.The venom leveled against this film by some of the IMDb reviewers is indicative of the reactions EXISTO elicits: viewers either love it or hate it. I've seen this at every showing; like a Guy Maddin film or offbeat musical oddities like FORBIDDEN ZONE or CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL, EXISTO brooks no safe middle ground. Walkouts happen, but those who are caught in the film's glow find it intoxicating, and are cheering by the finale. Those of us who love it want to see EXISTO reach a much wider audience, and it hasn't lost its bite over the years. If anything, the teeth sink deeper, as the reality of US politics and society are closer to the fictional future EXISTO posited over seven years ago.The impatience of some viewers to any non-traditional form of cinematic satire shouldn't keep those receptive to this gem away. Give it a shot -- it's a great film!",9
839,I'm speechless.,"The whole film appeared to be one big rant about how much the makers hate conservatives. As much as I may share their opinions, I honestly think there are other things you can put in your movie. The word 'plot' comes to mind.I also wish to point out that nearly all the positive reviews here are from Nashville (where this was filmed) or in the surrounding Tennessee area. It makes me wonder if the people reviewing had anything to do with the actual production, and if they have anything better to do than write themselves positive reviews with temporary IMDb user names like ""Scott Smith"", who only ever wrote one review for this movie. I'm assuming that a certain someone has this page on bookmark, and make a point of visiting it at least once a week to read reviews. Yes, I mean you. I can only guess as to the ratings this review will get.",2
840,Amazing Movie,"""'Existo' crashes and burns with its trite political humor that completely fails at even garnering the slightest of smirks."" We'll have to chalk that comment up to different senses of humor, because everyone I saw this with and I more than slightly smirked. This movie is hilarious.""They just wanted to make a quirky, original film and weren't sure if anyone would like it. But Coke Sams is actually trying to intentionally make a cult classic here."" If that's the case, then he did one hell of a good job. It's a quirky, original, great film.""The film opens with a voice-over that tells of a dystopian, ultra-conservative future. Yeah, really subtle."" I agree with you on this point. If you get to see the original version of the film, give that a shot--it opens with a musical number and goes right into the story. Much better opening than the voice-over.""Arnston does all sorts of Zaney things that you'd see on one of those live-action children's shows on PBS"" Whoa, they have people singing while bouncing on penis-pogo-sticks on PBS? ""This film was made in Nashville, and you'll note that almost all of the positive user comments are from anonymous users from Tennessee, most likely friends of Sams or even members of the crew who produced this abomination, perhaps even Sams himself."" I'm from nowhere near Tennessee and didn't even know Coke Sams' name before seeing this. It's just a great movie. Art is subjective. Humor is subjective. Don't skip out on this movie because one reviewer hated it. It's brilliant.",10
841,A Playful Poke in the Eye of Conservative Censorship,"It's a future in which the government and the media are controlled by right-wing religious fundamentalists.  The writings of William Bennett have been canonized into the Bible, and art has been outlawed.  Welcome to Existo's world.  Existo (played by Bruce Arntson) is a manic, charismatic performance artist, living legend, and guru/leader of the guerilla art resistance movement bent on turning a repressive theocracy on it's ear and making the streets safe for art.This is a delightful little indie from Nashville, written by Artnson and Coke Sams (both of whom who are responsible for the ""Ernest"" movies).  Make no mistake, however; this is by no means a family movie.  A particular musical sequence involving an anatomically impressive pogo stick and and backup vocalists with gynecological headgear would likely earn this film a R (or perhaps even an NC-17).Among the memorable characters: Maxine (played by ""Ernest"" alumnus Jackie Welch) is Existo's lover/sidekick and is a real joy to watch; Jim Varney (of...well, you know) gives a brief appearance as beatnik Marcel Horowitz; Gailard Sartain (""The Patriot,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes"") stars as the living-extra-large drag queen and nightclub owner Colette Watchuwill; Mark Cabus (""The Client"") is convincing as smarmy provocateur Roupen Dupree who is commissioned by the President to lure Existo over to the government's side to undermine the art resistance; and Ray Thornton in his first theatrical film is wonderful as Vigo, a hyperactive Irish leather-clad bomb expert.The music in the movie is great fun and highlights Existo's sometimes ""Carrey-esque"" mannerisms and speaking style (not to mention the high caliber of the local musicians used for the film).Yes, it's three shades of hammy in places (such as a roomful of hardened street artists bursting into melodramatic tears during Existo's ""I Will Cry"" song).  Sure, the low budget keeps all of the art terrorism off camera (with the exception of the aftermath at a shopping mall).  Of course the whole religion aspect is played over-the-top, don't forget it was filmed in Nashville.  But it's also a gem of an indie, and a hell of a lot of fun to watch.  The tunes are infectious as well.  In a world filled with low-budget Gen-X angst, it's a welcome change.",7
842,9/10........Great indie flick,"Very creative movie. The music is amazing in this movie. The writing in this movie is also amazing expressing everything thats wrong with government today into a strong movie. Listen to the words and the points that are made in this movie.Bruce Arnston stars as Existo the leader of this rebel group who knows the truth about the government. The government brainwashed the people into believing everything they do is right and use ""God"" as the reason for what they are doing. Great music. Stars Bruce Arnston, Jackie Welch, and Jim Varney. I bought the DVD and cd. I give it 9/10. You can buy it on existo.com and it will soon be in stores.",9
843,destined to be a cult classic!,it's been a long time since rocky horror.  the kids of today are ready for existo.  this movie took me by so much surprise.  musical masterpieces throughout.  and a special final appearance for the late jim varney.  i wish i could take this movie intravenously...  know whutta mean?!!,10
844,No twang in this Nashville film...move over Rocky Horror,"Existo, written by starring character Bruce Arntson and director Coke Sams, provides a wild, witty, weird movie with ready for prime time actors. Filmed in Nashville this is the most creative movie that I have seen in a decade or more.  Original score and great musical numbers...the art world battles the religious right and both come out looking fairly ridiculous but oh so funny. This political satire with farce and slapstick has some incredibly great (adult) dialogue and lyrics - which everyone needs to view and hear more than once. Some outstanding performances by mostly Nashville actors  entertain us in this film.Somebody pick up this movie! We want to see and hear this movie/music again on screen and CD!!!",10
845,Rocky Horror for the new millennium!,"Weird characters, fabulous songs, thoughtful ideas wrapped in singing and dancing. EXISTO believes that the last hope against the Christian Right is freedom of speech and art. Amazingly entertaining and hilariously funny...for an art film. Leave the kids at home.",10
846,Guerilla war by avant garde against the religious right.,"If you like your satire broad and biting, do not miss this over-the-top depiction of the conflict between political polar opposites.  Neither the left nor the right is left unscathed.  It is very raunchy, but not with the usual sophomoric raunch of teen sex comedies.  It has a high sacrilege content as well.Enjoy!",10
847,No sacred cows here!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it highly.  While it is most definitely an ""art"" film, it's not the angst ridden, woe-is-me, aren't I cool in my terminal boredom sort.  Unlike many independent films, neither the protagonists nor the antagonists are shown in an exalted light.The dialogue is brilliant, witty and quick.  The art direction and performances are engaging.  What I found most impressive, however was the music.  It seemed to be crossbred between David Byrne, Tom Waits, the Blues Brothers, and the Residents.  I can't recommend this film highly enough.  I desperately hope that it will get a more extensive distribution so that my friends in other states can see it.",10
848,"A rave review of the film, Existo","This film, Existo, is the funniest, most delightful, sick comedy I've seen in years! It pokes at the left, the right, the artsy crowd, the politicians, the suburbanites and just about everything else with equal vim and vigor. The most frightening thing about this movie is that Existo's wanderings into that ""dark void"" actually make some sense. I'll have to go back and see it again, though, I was howling too hard to catch everything he said.",10
849,Simply one of my favorite movies of all time,"A really important movie and a must see for anyone who considers himself or herself an artist. Interesting to note this movie(1999), which is set in a time when there is a right wing fascist fundamentalist Christian takeover of the US predates G W Bush's presidency, therefore Ashcroft had not yet covered up the breasts of statues when this movie was released.The message about freedom of expression, the way it is feared by those who would seek to control thought is the central brilliance of this film. It continues to serve as an inspiration to me in my artistic work.The music and the musical performances are absolutely genius and would be appreciated on their own merit by anyone who is an educated listener.So, if you like your political messages delivered with humor and great music, check out this film.",10
850,Only watch this movie while stoned,"Mad Dogs is definitely one of those movies where its subjective quality goes up in direct proportion to the viewer's level of intoxication. And there must have been some really good drugs at work when they made this over in Great Britain.Theoretically, the movie is about Rabbie Burns (Iain Fraser), a schizophrenic who's just being released from his treatment program. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't last a day before he starts hearing voices again. These voices, however, claim not to be hallucinations. Rather, they're working with a pigman who shows up on Rabbie's TV and tells him to stop the American government from using a teleporting explosive to blow up a planet hundreds of light years away from Earth, or alien forces will reduce Earth to a burned out cinder. That leads to Rabbie, his girlfriend Narendra (Indira Varma) and his homeless, saxophone playing buddy Jimmy Joyce (Paul Barber) running to and fro around London, encountering a bizarrely theatrical British cop, three Men in Black from America and conversing with The Supreme Being (Jonathan Pryce) over a hotel television, before the dead rise from the grave and decide to hang out at Rabbie's apartment. Oh, and all of the dogs in Great Britain have caught a deadly strain of Mad Cow disease and are being destroyed.Somebody was smoking something when they came up with that. I've watched British costume dramas, British crime flicks, British war/colonial movies and more but I'm not really sure what genre of British film-making Mad Dogs fits into. The closest thing I can compare it to is a 90 minute long Monty Python sketch where one absurd situation is piled on top of another without any real payoff at the end. None of the actors are trying to play things seriously, yet the film isn't funny either. It's quirky and eccentric and maybe there's a bunch of British cultural references being touched on throughout the movie, but to me it's the equivalent of a bunch of American teenagers getting hopped up on cold medicine and trying to make a movie one afternoon with their parents' old video camera.Mad Dogs is also filled with as much profanity as any movie not featuring a concert performance by Eddie Murphy in a leather suit. There's almost a Tourette's Syndrome quality to the dialog, with the F word joining ""I"" and ""the"" as the most commonly used words in the English language.If you're looking to get severely drunk or stoned and want to watch something that will leave a deep impression on your malleable psycheMad Dogs is definitely a good candidate. If you're sober, though, you'd probably enjoy anything else moreeven a movie starring Pauly Shore and Steven Seagal as twin brothers separated a birth who reunite to save their sister's ostrich ranch from the Albanian mob.",3
851,Bizarre fun,"I really really liked this film. I couldn't tell you why (though an early warping by monty python, red dwarf, ghost stories and apocalyptic movies might have had something to do with it) and it's definitely NOT for everyone. I don't think I could predict who will like this film but I have a sneaking suspicion that mundanes need not apply. Ghost stories around the campfire at night at the age of 30? probably. Yuppie? probably not. If you do like this you might check out Dead Gentleman Productions' Demon Hunters. Sillier with a lower budget, but...it's worth a check out. Only one burning question remains for me... What was up with that damn bulldog?",7
852,Bloody Awful,"London, one year from today... The dogs of England are dying, of ""Mad Dog Disease,"" and Rabbie Burns, young drifter and certified schizophrenic, is hearing voices again - on Underground trains, over supermarket speakers, and on his own T.V. He has 30 hours, a last weekend, to save the world from itself, before the ""Supreme Being"" himself loses patience and starts over, with a new species.And we're supposed to care? The movie is a mess. It's awful in the way can only be achieved in the UK. Not really a drama. I suppose it's a comedy of sorts, but it's not so funny. But it IS boring. There's even a guy with a bad pig snout on the tellie.There are only a handful of reviews. One says to watch it stoned. I don't think that would help.And another -- obviously from someone linked to the director -- give it ten stars! It's bloody awful.",1
853,"An excellent, mind boggling movie, A must-see for Londoners,","Right from the start, this movies keeps you on the edge of your seat, controlling both your mind and soul. A fantastic sci-fi movie with a realistic approach, mixed with threads of comedy; a must-see for Londoners.The unique plot was well laid out and easily to follow for both sci-fi enthusiasts and newcomers.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it sparked off a realistic spectrum of enthusiastic ideas for the future.This is definitely one of my favourite sci-fi flicks - don't miss it! 10/10",10
854,A thought provoking and entertaining movie.,I loved the movie because it entertained me and made me think of the future in equal measure. It conveys a serious message in a light hearted way. The movie is well produced and directed and has the feel of a big budget movie.,10
855,"bonkers, wacky movie, director was probably on drugs, nothing to do with dogs","This is some messed up film, made zero sense and i felt quite ill by the end of it. It's seriously saying something that this was the directors only film. I would show this movie to friends but i don't have any so i cannot. Cheers to Netflix for this, i cannot get my 1 hour 31 minutes back. The cover is of a man running but no man is running in that position in the film and the American people in the film were goofy. It had nothing to do with dogs and the dogs barely make an appearance in a movie called mad dogs. There was some dogs but not enough dogs to suffice to the name of the movie. Watch at your own risk.",2
856,When life and love collide.,"There are films that are produced out of the ""film structure"", that are seen by a few lucky pair of eyes, which is regrettable . This is one such movie. ""Alem de Ti"" is one of the best films that I've had the opportunity to see . The fabric that is made of is engaging ans mesmerizing. Across a story of common mortals, we are presented with a cruel reality and all the symbolism that flows behind our eyes. The impact of unemployment and despair in a marriage, how man and woman react to the disintegration of their lives, the same moments lived so differently . Simply cruel and memorable. This film also shows the flaw that exists in Portuguese film structure , when these projects are only possible to be done independently, either by rules, either by jury of rejection. However, this film enjoys a freedom that it would not be possible within a structure. It's an awesome film that shows the strength of the Portuguese Independent Cinema.",9
857,Another good film portraying the implosion of Yugoslavia in the 90s,"In the two years since the official end of the Bosnian ""civil"" war in late 1995, wartime conditions fester on in the little Muslim town where this film is set. Lack of goods breeds a robust black market. Lack of money means lousy health care and schools. Vengeful rage between Muslim villagers and Serbs from an adjacent town simmers close to the surface daily. Land mines continue to kill and maim. A broken old man carries on conversations with the dead son who visits him regularly. And then intriguing news arrives: U.S. President Bill Clinton is coming to visit.The mayor immediately grasps the possibilities here: putting his town on the map, attracting tourists and fresh capital. He sets about hiding or destroying any evidence of malfeasance and unrest. Even the firemen of the town are forced to buddy up to their Serb counterparts nearby, in a show of solidarity and mended fences. Serbs are exhorted to spend a day in the town, pretending to have returned permanently. On the day of Clinton's visit, the mayor even finds a gaudy necktie to wear that is covered with dollar signs ($).The American song rehearsed by school kids for the reception is ""House of the Rising Sun,"" quite apt in a place where the flesh trade is an important aspect of the local economy. Myriad such ironies, along with dark humor, corruption, Romany musical riffs, and violence barely contained - in short, all the usual ingredients of films from the fragmented states of the former Yugoslavia - are on display here.The story, written by the director, Mr. Zalica, is first rate, weaving individual dramas affecting several characters within the larger subtext, the seriously blighted condition that continues to typify Bosnia. The director, who teaches his craft in Sarajevo, evokes excellent performances from nearly every actor here, especially Bagdan Diklic, who plays Zaim, the aging former police chief; Izudin Bajrovic as Mugdim, the powerful, duplicitous fellow who replaced Zaim as Chief; Admir Glamocak as Hamdo, the skinny, cynical fireman; and Senad Basic as Velija, kingpin of illicit trade in the area.Things go seriously amiss at the end, though all is not lost. As Elvis Mitchell so nicely put it, writing in the New York Times, ""The title of (this) incident-filled but relaxed and oddly courtly comedy-drama isn't exactly misleading. Watching the story unfold is akin to watching a ridiculously extended fuse burn for so long that you almost forget there's a bomb at the end."" I would rank this film only a little lower on my ""Yugoslavian implosion"" favorites list than Emir Kusturica's stunning and bitterly funny hit film, ""Underground."" ""Fuse"" is currently part of the touring Global Lens 2005 series. This film deserves wider commercial distribution in the U.S. (In Bosnian, or Serbo-Croatian if you prefer, & English). My rating: 7.5/10 (low B+). (Seen on 04/17/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",8
858,The best tragi-comedy I've ever seen...maybe the best ever for this genre!,"I don't normally recommend films here in IMDB, but this one is a 4-star endeavor from a relatively new filmmaker from Bosnia. The USA title is FUSE so keep your eye out for it if it gets distributed here. If you liked the Oscar-winning Bosnian film ""No Man's Land"" then this film should be right up your alley. In this story, instead of the Serbs and Bosnians fighting they are forced to join together to welcome the arrival of an American President to their area. Excellent cast and very good blend of humor and poignancy. I really can't recommend this film highly enough and I wonder why no USA distributors have glommed onto it (somebody's asleep at the wheel). It will be screened in New York City for the New Director's festival (courtesy of MOMA and LCFS) in the next couple weeks...if you're in the neighborhood this is BEST BET if there ever was one!",8
859,Great movie! Winner of Silver Leopard award at this year's Locarno film festival!,"This bittersweet comedy is set in a tiny, rustic village where Serbs and Muslims still carry memories of war, where arms caches continue to be uncovered and an uneasy peace reigns.The town has a mayor, but a gangster and a cop really rule the roost. Cocky, lank-haired operator Velija owns the local brothel - controlling imported girls by confiscating their passports - and illegally runs Kurdish and Chinese people into Croatia for a tidy profit. The local chief of police provides Velija's business with protection in return for a healthy cut. International inspectors are trying to re-educate - and foster harmony among - the local fire brigade of Serbs and Muslims; things work after a fashion, but hatreds run deep - returning Serbs are shunned and verbal abuse is commonplace.Everything changes, though, with the announcement that Bill Clinton will be visiting their village in the next few days. Crime has to be swept under the carpet and a false, but clean, facade must be erected.With its wonderful mix of gently farcical elements reminiscent of so many great Yugoslav films of previous eras (Milos Forman's The Firemen's Ball also comes to mind), Zalica's portrait of post-war Bosnia is loving, but brutally honest. His ironic eye poignantly registers tragedy all around - most notably in the moving portrait of the former police chief, Zaim, who mourns the adult son he lost in the war. When Zaim digs his gun out of the garden and sets off to settle scores on the eve of the President's visit, drama is imminent.Fuse is a remarkable work about a catastrophic legacy, told with humour and an unerring sense of the irrational, very real tragedy of the Bosnian war.",10
860,"Pjer Zalica, a name to remember","When I looked at the vote I could not believe it scored a 6.9. I'm happy to see that many voters gave this film a straight 10, which I concur with wholeheartedly. Surely the 1's and 2's are not about the film, possibly politically motivated. The film has a lot to tell, and does so in a very intelligent way. These are real people, the thin veneer of magic realism adds to the atmosphere and reminds us of how absurd life often is. The film shows us the aftermath of an ethnic conflict, yet irony beats tragedy, game, set and match in this film. Superb acting, fast paced, good montage. History tends to paint big events in black and white, yet with this film the viewer realizes again that on a human scale life if full of nuances.",10
861,Waiting for Clinton,"On one level, I find Pjer Zalica's ""Gori vatra"" (called ""Fuse"" in English) interesting because it shows us a culture that we rarely get to see. But beyond that, I like it's focus on people's lives and associations. The movie portrays a small town in Bosnia. The town has seen its share of problems, and tensions persist between the Bosnians and Serbs. That's when they hear that Bill Clinton will be visiting. Not only does everyone do their darnedest to fix up the town, but a diplomat comes to try and make peace between the Bosnians and Serbs, and some of the characters realize the flaws in their relationships with each other and the come to understand the mistakes that they've made in their lives. All the while, the local children are learning The Animals' ""House of the Rising Sun"" to sing to Clinton. But a surprise lies in wait.So is the main focus on the results of the 1990s civil war in the Balkans, or on another aspect? Hard to say exactly. But I will say that I admired the movie, as a look at how recent history has affected the people in the region, and as a look at how sudden events throw people's lives into flux. Worth seeing.",8
862,Beautifully captured Bosnian tragi-comedy,"Fuse as the title suggests is a story about patience. It's about a wonders of normal people living in an abnormal situation, about their hope for a better life, about their temper, and about whoever knows any ex-Yugoslavs about their famous temper, their fuse. Bosnia and Herzegovina 2 years after a war which ravaged this region for so long. Tesanj is a small not so important village on which surface you can see good neighborhoods, local market, honest people, tradition and friendliness. But underneath there is hunger, hidden dangerous minefields, ethnical intolerance, widespread and well organized criminal, prostitution and total corruption. Then suddenly out of nowhere amazing information comes in. American president personally is planning a visit to this in the middle of nowhere village, so the race against time starts to clean up the corrupted system and establish some missing democracy. The dialogues are memorable and the local humor is highly original but like in the past standout classics (""No man's Land, Pretty Willage Pretty Flame) the irony of the after-war situation is very well captured.Its fascinating how effortlessly the whole surreal situation of this once beautiful country is portrayed trough some series of tragic-comic scenes. Like Pjer Zalica commented himself; ""We were brave to laugh at our troubles and problems during the past difficult decade. I've realized that during the war years I was doing war documentaries and war movies, still after all this there is belief in the better life"" That is exactly the message that you like a viewer should get from this movie, that after all the darkness there can only be light, and that as their original humor the optimism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is very much alive.Andreja Kmetovic",9
863,Well crafted movie with many subtle details,"This is a good movie.It shows many aspects of life in the aftermath of Bosnian war in one small village on the border of Bosnian and Serbian entity. Border represents a place where people will come together eventually.Movie starts with a land mine explosion which maim young woman. Her father will take her to Germany where they were living during the war. He will say: Bosnia will never see me again.For those who stay there life goes on.There is mafia business going on which involves human trafficking, prostitution and black market with some police forces involved. Everyday life taken to extremes in the aftermath of war. City coming to normality (if ever, but life will find its ways and definitively an attempt has to be made). Supposed coming of American president to the village serves as backbone around all the life stories circles.Real central story is chief policeman Zaim (went insane after his soon died in Serbia) search for his soon. He has contacts with ghost of his soon. These are beautifully shown moments of the tortured soul looking for peace. He will find peace in suicidal explosion which burns his whole house and kills him. Hence the name of the film Fire's burning. Acoompanying music is House of the Rising Soon. His younger son receives condolence from his fire-fighters colleagues - Serbs and Bosnian. At the end of movie, younger son tells to ghosts of his brother and father that they should leave him alone for a while.All parts of the movie are crafted excellently with subtle details.",9
864,"funny, desperate, realistic, negative, emotional","This is one of best war comedies. It is showing so much desperation, immoral, reality, corruption, relationships...and all stuff as it was after the Bosnian war. Nice presence of various unique and funny characters and good topic. Feelings of desperation dominate, which is relevant for the situation or topic. Good topic - the president's visit, which is what very close to real life's event. High presence of soldiers, police, government, makes this quality. The best are emotions which even if negative are so real and deep, and remind me not only of war but also anything smaller than than that is desperate such as financial, relationship, religious problems. The way that desperation is presented is so convincing, religious, moral, and deep. But also funny and like fairy-tale or dream. So sad, funny, deep, serious, magical. Mixed feelings. The only bad thing is lack of some real action and too negative. Good actors which I recognize from other good movies and series, especially Bosnia ones.",9
865,Kush weak movie,Kush doesn't fire. I don't if it's because I'm tired of low budget movies trying to rip off Hollywood movies or if Kush is weak on it's own merits. I agree with other reviewers that this was an attempt to cash in on Alpha Dog with Timberlake. Funny poop about it is Alpha Dog wasn't a movie worth ripping off. It was a so-so Hollywood movie itself. I rented Kush because of what I saw and read on it's cover. Director York Shackelton showed glimpses there is a director under there. Maybe next time they will get original enough to make their own move not a alpha Dog rip off. Like a 5th grade book report I will close out with IN CONCLUSION KUSH WAS A WEAK MOVIE NOT WORTH WATCHING. THANK YOU.,2
866,Apart from the fact that you have already seen this movie...,"If you saw Alpha Dog, this is not similar, it is almost identical. And not as well done.Other than that, it isn't really a bad movie. It's a combination of action (very little) and drama (a fair amount but not especially compellingly rendered). There is a message to the movie, which is clearly anti-drug, and involves parents who made poor choices raising children who make poor choices. But it isn't really a preachy kind of film. It's more like a laid back rendition of a pathological cultural underside to wealthy Americana. Maybe a little too laid back, for none of the characters are riveting or especially interesting. The drug trade aspects seem realistically portrayed, but I wonder how often drug dealers like this refuse to traffic in specific drugs.It'll do for entertainment for an evening. But don't get your expectations up too ""high"", especially if you have already seen Alpha Dog. At least the babes are attractive, although the sexuality is muted.",5
867,Pretty Good Movie,I saw Kush and yes it is like the Alpha Dog movie but it is still good and the actors are good. If you like Alpha Dog you will like this. I enjoyed the actors struggle with trying to leave the drug business but being connected through ties with the family and the friends and money that made it hard to leave. I actually enjoyed Kush better than Alpha Dog because the characters seemed more real to me. There was a lot of action going on and the story was interesting the whole way through it made the point and did not drag on unnecessarily. I was really surprised to see William Atherton from Ghostbusters and James Duval from Gone With Sixty Seconds they made the movie better.,5
868,JHhaja,Such a basic bi@ch of a film. kush is a strain not a generic name for weed/cannabis,1
869,"""Too much free time, too much freedom, too much money.""","I would almost compare this film to all those exploitation flicks of the Thirties and Forties that attempted to warn the general public about the evils of drugs, alcohol and prostitution. The quality is about the same as those pictures which were done in black and white, and the anti-drug message comes through with the snowballing consequences that occur over a drug deal gone wrong. There aren't even any redeeming quality characters here, usually you'll have a least one you could relate to but they're all low-life's looking for an easy score. A not so subtle tie-in is made with the idea that the young adults involved got where they're at due to a life of ease afforded by rich but inattentive parents, thereby looking for an alternative life style that appeals to a need for kicks and attention. I won't give any of it away, you can check it out if you're interested, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. It's low budget is readily apparent and the actors are merely adequate in a story that's probably way too common in the sordid world of dealing drugs.",5
870,Cool movie!,"If you didn't know, this movie is going to be available on Video On Demand (VOD) starting December 1st, 2009. This is going to be for a limited time, so don't miss the opportunity to see this great movie, and check your local listings for the time! I like to watch movies where the theme involves everyday situations, and action at the same time. Kush, in my opinion, is one of the movies that would get you a little closer to what a real world of a drug dealer is. And how with a slight mistake, can put his life on risk, and even all the money that he can get, won't be enough to stop his family, and friends to be destroyed. With this movie you can enter into a world of reality, that in may cases we don't have idea how cruel and scary it is.",8
871,Kusch,"this film is very reminiscent of alpha dog... i would put money on it that the adaptation is about the young lad Nicholas Mankowski who was kidnapped and murdered by Jesse Hollywood and his crew.. over a debt by Nicholas Markowski's brother Ben... its too much like the film alpha dog not to be.. nick was kidnapped by Hollywood ,rugge Hoyt and others because Ben Markowski would not pay up a drug debt.. at first they beat the boy up but then realised the seriousness of what they had done by kidnapping him started to panic ...feeding him Valium and pot to keep him calm they moved nick from house to house .. after 3 days of this they told the young lad they were going to take him home ..put him in a car and drove him to lizards creek .. smashed the young lad over the head with a shovel and put him in a shallow grave ...then the Hoyt monster took out a tec-9 automatic machine gun and riddled the young lad with bullets... Nicholas Markowski was found days later by passing hikers .... r.i.p. Nicholas Markowski..",10
872,Great Movie!,"I'm guessing the reason this movie is rated so low is because nobody's seen it. I actually didn't think it was the greatest thing in the world the first time I saw it, until I found myself thinking about it over and over again the next day. Since then, I've watched it 14 times. Why? It just seems very real-life to me. I found the characters and the drug deals to be super realistic, and the plot is consistently thorough. I also found some compelling characters-- Todd, Christian, and Johnny (the Canadian) I found to be pretty magnetic. Especially Todd!! He is just such a realistic sketchball. We all know somebody like him. Perhaps a ten out of ten seems a little overblown, but hey, not many movies could I get through 15 times. Granted, this is a movie that I tend to watch after a few, uh, drinks, but still.",10
873,This movie was quite stupid,"An aging Yakuza boss decides to retire, and dreams of one day seeing James Brown perform live again, just like when he first saw him in the 60's. As an order from his number 2, 3 of his clan members decide to kidnap James Brown so he can perform for the boss personally, but they instead capture a look-a-like.This movie was absolutely stupid. The plot was stupid, the laughs were not there when they were meant to be, and nothing stood out as being exceptional or even mediocre.I don't care if you are a huge James Brown fan. This movie is utterly bad. 1/10",1
874,"Moving, funny, tragic, inspiring","I caught this movie a few weeks ago when I went up to Montreal for the World Film Festival, and I was a little shocked at how terrific it was. It's the story of a woman in a mental institution who seems convinced that she is a princess. As the film goes on, she uses this delusion to create a new world for the other asylum inmates that is fuller, deeper and in many ways far more humane than anything the institution offers them. That makes the film sound like something left over from the Sixties -- one of those insufferable movies that scold us all for not being as child-like and simple as the mentally ill. But one of the many pleasures and surprises of Princess is that the director, Arto Halonen, complicates the situation, and brings a remarkable compassion and complexity to his view of all the characters, even the ones who at first seem least sympathetic. This is filmmaking in the Renoir style, where we're not so much pressured to pass judgment as to enter the ever-deepening humanity of people caught up in a very difficult situation. The conflict between the Princess and one of the institute's leaders, for instance, has many different layers to it, and while Halonen's sympathies are clearly with the Princess, he gives the leader his due as a man who wants to do the right thing but is badly misguided in his devotion to the latest medical advances -- shock treatment and lobotomy. Even more strikingly, the film manages to hold onto this complex, humane approach while being tremendously entertaining. The actors, particularly the one who plays the Princess, all find large reserves of humor in their roles, and the relationship between the Princess and her best friend is both exhilarating and, in the end, deeply moving, as it leads towards a terrible tragedy. Yet the final effect of the film is more inspiring than tragic, as Halonen places the life of the Princess and her impact on the mental institution into their long-term perspective. This is really a stunning movie, and you should definitely watch it when it comes to the U.S.",10
875,The reality just is too boring..?,"In 1945 a mental hospital receives a patient who will be known to all as Princess. The patient is fortunate because the staff at hospital will attempt to cure the patients relying on various new methods, that aren't too schoolbook-like. In this somewhat 'liberal' environment Princess will become known to all as some kind of Her Royal Highness who can, maybe surprisingly too, treat everyone as if she really possessed the grace and power of a sovereign. But of course the reality will always strike back, softer or harder.The movie is based on real events which roll by in fast but still at an enjoyable pace. The film could be enjoyable too because it contains a good deal of the top cream of contemporary Finnish actors, not to mention the Finnish rock star Paula Vesala who makes a decent, if not just great, debut on the screen as a supporting actress. Despite the film is about a serious mental illness I couldn't but laugh at few scenes - even if some scenes are really tragic and even terrifying, no one can escape the fact that life never needs to be too serious even if the environment is against you.",9
876,Finnish actress Katka Kukkola appears as the most sane person in a film about madness.,"As a theme,madness is rather difficult to portray not only in cinema but also in other fields of art.It has a lot to do with a formal definition of the word ""madness"" as madness has its own fair share of plausible interpretations.This is probably one reason why the theme of madness and its interpretation are always challenging be it through the works of French philosopher Michel Foucault or its portrayal in mainstream films such as ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".It must also be added that there is a marked difference in the manner Europeans like to deal with madness as opposed to what their American counterparts would do.Arto Halonen's Finnish film ""Prinsessa""/Princess is a different cinematographic experience as it thoroughly ensures that all its characters are treated in the same manner as other sane people are treated.For this reason,the film relies heavily on its leading actress Katka Kukkola whose saga of erratic,madcap behavior makes one wonder whether there is really some hidden sense in madness or it is just a different name given to the mystery surrounding life's pranks in which everybody would like to indulge.Lastly,princess is based on a true story wherein the director has succeeded in staying close to the actual events by taking complete control of his imagination by making room for innumerable moments of hilarity.",8
877,In The Red,"Suspense thriller? There was not a jot of suspense all through, I was more interested in the film's ending not because the twist would be revealed in the last reel but because it would mean the end of the 1 hour 45 minutes discomfiture. Even Himesh Reshammiya's great music couldn't make it better. Aftab's acting was good but Celina does not even know the ABC of acting all she knows is how to show off her body. In most of the scenes there is definitely something that has a red colour e.g. Aftab's red shirt, Amrita's red top, Celina's red dress and red light in the night club that is an OK idea because it kept on reminding you of the title but when the whole screen goes red before the next scene that was far to annoying. The story was good but it was far too slow although it's nearly 2 hours it seems like a 3-hour movie. The ending was quite clever but what is the use of watching a film for its ending?",3
878,Red is a picture that's devoid of any artistic credibility at all.,"Some films should never be made and Vikram Bhatt's Red is exactly that kind of film. Disguised as a thriller, Red is the most predictable film you've possibly seen, even a four-year-old can correctly guess where it's all leading up to. What's worse, you can make that guess 10 minutes into the film. The sorry excuse for a plot centres around Aftab Shivdasani who's saved from imminent death by a heart transplant. The heart in question belonged to a man who just died in a car accident. This man happens to be Celina Jaitley's husband and less than 10 minutes since he's discharged from hospital Aftab starts stalking Celina.Before you know it, the two of them are chewing each others lips off and making out like a pair of rabbits. As the affair continues, Aftab learns from Celina that her husband had been having an affair with her best friend Amrita Arora, who's responsible for her husband's death. When Celina complains she's being harassed by the person who killed her husband on Amrita's instructions, Aftab kills the guy to protect his lady. But it all becomes an ugly mess when the police discover enough clues that are traced back to Aftab. You know, it doesn't even take an expert to point out the root cause for why this film doesn't work – it's got a plot that's as flimsy as Celina Jaitley's nightgown. Believe me, I've read class five essays that are better written. What amazes me is the fact that nobody who worked on this film realised that something as basic as common sense was so badly missing in the script. As a result, every minute of this film is sheer torture to endure.When you don't have a story to tell, why make a film at all? That's the question I'd like to ask the producer, the director and the writer of Red who have wasted both money and time in bringing this nonsense to screen. Vikram Bhatt once made some half-way decent Hollywood rip-offs, remember Kasoor and Raaz – they weren't too bad. Red as far as I can see, is not a copy of a Hollywood film – which makes perfect sense because Hollywood wouldn't be so stupid to make such a rubbish film. I must add here that throwing in a generous dollop of love-making can't salvage a film as lame as this. So, all the heaving and sighing, all the grunting and moaning, all the bumping and grinding between Aftab and Celina, does nothing for Red. Of the principal cast, it's a miracle Amrita Arora manages to show what a lousy actress she is in barely five minutes of screen time. Celina Jaitley, for her part, has close to two hours to display her incompetence. Doused in make-up, even while doing a wet, shower scene, she simpers and whimpers and plays the damsel in distress so unconvincingly, you're willing to pay her admission fees to a good acting class. By virtue of the fact that the other two perform so badly, Aftab Shivdasani comes off looking just marginally better, although this is hardly the kind of work to be proud of. There are very few films that have no merits at all, usually you'll like at least something in every film. But Red is a picture that's devoid of any artistic credibility at all. I still don't know what's the significance of the title. Did they call it Red because they anticipated the colour of anger that you'll be consumed with after seeing the film? Or is it because Red rhymes with ""dead"" which is how you feel when you leave the cinema?",1
879,Unforgettable guilt pleasure!!,"Red: The Dark Side review :Before hitting gold with the horror genre, Vikram Bhatt dabbled in everything from love stories to hard core action to erotic thrillers. Red: The Dark Side was one such erotic drama he directed starring Aftab (Faffy) Shivadasani, Celina Jaitley and Amrita Arora. It was quite an unforgettable experience for me at Movetime Starcity, Matunga where there were just a handful of patrons with me in the Saturday late evening show. I had strolled in to the cinema after enjoying a couple of drinks with my friends and that could be the reason I actually enjoyed the film tremendously as a guilt pleasure.Red starts with a depressed looking Faffy who gets his ailing heart transplanted from a donor. The inquisitive type that he is, Faffy gets the information about his donor from his doctor friend (the ever pretty Kishori Shahane in a cameo) and then sets to befriend his donor's widow (Celina Jaitley) who is convinced her hubby was murdered by his girlfriend (Amrita Arora) with whom he was having an extra-marital. Oof!!The acting was minimalistic. So was the lead actors clothing particularly Celina Jaitley.. Admittedly, she looked damn hot in the movie and I loved her more here than even in her debut Janasheen (2003). Nah, it wasn't the 'daaru' influence, I bet ya!! Faffy was totally misfit in his role and he transformed many serious moments in to unintentional hilarity. Amrita got relegated to sidelines due to her ill-written character. She looked stunning though!!The best part of Red was Himesh Reshammiya's songs which were mostly utilized for lovemaking scenes between Faffy and hottie Celina. Normally, I have seen people walk out for a smoke during songs but no one ventured out during Red probably as they didnt want to miss the sex scenes.Don't wish to play spoiler (not that you would care..), but Red ended on an expected note where you knew who the culprit was long before...but I still walked out getting my tickets worth. This is one guilt pleasure cinema I will never forget. Cheers!!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni.",6

881,"""Uptown Girls""  9/10. Murphy makes it work and gives this movie its charm.","The plot to ""Uptown Girls"" is that it centers on Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy), who is the spoiled, 22-year old daughter of a deceased rock legend. When the manager steals her money, she's left broke and for the first time in her life, has to actually work.  So she gets a job being a nanny to Ray (Dakota Fanning), the neglected daughter of an overworked music executive. She doesn't really have much of a choice, since she has no ""real"" working skills or experience being employed.  The two bond and become best friends and so on.True this film's plot slightly resembles Adam Sandler's 1999 comedy ""Big Daddy,"" another film where an irresponsible adult is given the daunting task of playing parent to a neglected child.  Where the more serious moments of the story to ""Big Daddy"" took a back seat to silly toilet humor, ""Uptown Girls"" is able to soar high above the required material and become something truly unique.  ""Big Daddy"" was great, too and got its message (if you can call it that) across without much trouble, and ""Uptown Girls"" does the same, and then something greater.Part of the fun of watching ""Uptown Girls"" is simply Murphy's presence on screen.  Watching this, I had to sometimes remember why she is one of today's youngest and most talented actresses.  Another reason would be her relationship with Dakota Fanning in the movie.  The two naturally start off not liking each other but as the film continues, they grow closer and closer together.I'm a guy and I don't normally like these kinds of movies (girlie-girl films), but ""Uptown Girls"" seems to be an exception, largely because of star Brittany Murphy.  She just has a kind of appeal that draws you in, whether you want to or not.  I guess that's why when I first saw a poster for this film at the movie theater a few months ago, I was drawn in to it, despite any misgivings I already had.  Murphy has a magnetic charm, a kind of screen presence that's normally lacking with a lot of young actresses working in today's Hollywood.  Roger Ebert stated in his review of the film that Murphy displays a kind of ineptitude that's reminiscent of the late Lucille Ball and plays it perfectly.  In this film, she is kind of a ditz, but it's all part of her emotional complexity.Another reason I wanted to see ""Uptown Girls"" is because Boaz Yakin, who helmed 1994's ""Fresh"" and 2000's ""Remember the Titans,"" is behind the camera.  He has a real eye for the characters in his films, in that he makes them do a lot more than what is expected of them.  This is why his two earlier films were so successful in that they went above and beyond the material to become something really special. I already know that a lot of people are not going to like this movie, but I think that we should at least give it a chance.  It's not going to do well at the box office, but I think bad scheduling (the much-anticipated ""Freddy vs. Jason"" reigned supreme at the box office when ""Girls"" was released) may have had a serious effect on its overall performance.",9
882,"Surprisingly likable, if not lovable!","Over the years, we've seen dozens of films labeled as chick-flicks that hold true to the same clichés, jokes and rehashed plots that have been done over and over again. After seeing a trailer for `Uptown Girls,' one would naturally think that the film would be a hopeless mesh of the same simple ideas of a lost girl or woman trying to find herself in the most unlikely of places. In all honesty, `Uptown Girls' is just that. However, it has some redeeming qualities that make it rise above its own conventional nature-it actually has an emotional depth to its characters that wouldn't occur under normal circumstances. Also, it stars Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning, two wonderful actresses that dazzle the screen with their very presence.	Molly (Murphy) is a woman in her mid-twenties who is completely detached from reality. Her deceased rock-star father has left her a wealth that affords her the finest apartment, friends and possessions that money can buy. However, life turns upside down for Molly when her broker skips town with all of her money. All of sudden Molly is faced with a world where everything she's been absorbed in has disappeared. Her only choice now is to get a job and start living life like a normal person. After several attempts at some of Manhattan's most elite shops, she accepts a position as a nanny for a friend's boss. But she has no idea what she's in for-a little girl named Ray (Fanning) who is completely obsessive and compulsive. What's more, she wants nothing to do with Molly. The two feel each other out and eventually start to discover that they have a great deal in common, as they are both suffering from the loss of the one's that they cared for most deeply. As such, they have both entered into their own delusional worlds that don't hold true to reality. It's up to the two to help each other out in finding a purpose in life and discovering the true beauty of friendship.	Fanning is truly the prize of `Uptown Girls.' She's an adorable young actress who can actually perform. She steals every scene she's in and the audience can't get enough of her. The moments in the film where she breaks down and cries, you get the impression that its real and this isn't acting-she has that the innate talent to become the characters that she portrays in the script marvelously. Look for her in the recent `I am Sam,' as well as in `The Cat in the Hat,' coming this November. 	Murphy proves once again that she is a gifted actress. I guess we can forgive her for this past winter's `Just Married,' as her track record generally shows her showing off real talent in films like `8 Mile,' and `Girl, Interrupted.' Her portrayal of Molly makes the audience feel sadness for her character, but at the same time, we can't help but feel that she is incredibly pathetic, and not in the comic sense. 	The most rewarding part of viewing `Uptown Girls' was how tender the film is. Murphy and Fanning come alive together and you feel their pain and the isolation that they have surrounded themselves in because of the lack of truly loving people in their lives. You walk out of the theater fond of the characters and rooting them on at the end, regardless of the film's parallels to so many others in the genre. 	`Uptown Girls' isn't a great movie, but it sure is something that is surprisingly likable, if not lovable. ***",7
883,funny and affecting though manipulative and sappy,"Rich girl loses all her money and has to be a nanny for an uptight brat; it certainly sounds like a bad movie in the making. But actually I quite enjoyed this one. The stars are appealing, a lot of the scenes are quite funny and even though the movie is predictable and maudlin it does have scenes with a genuine emotional impact. With a script that has some intelligence and nuance and actresses who bring sincerity and belief to rather clichéd characters (child-woman and woman-child, essentially), this movie winds up being far better than it has a right to be. I feel like I have to make excuses for liking it, because it is kind of dumb, but I really very much enjoyed it.",7
884,"Slow start, but definitely worth watching","As I say over and over again, a film doesn't have to be a work of art (that few even understand) to be a film. The keyword here is entertainment. And I thought this film was entertaining, not be confused with a work of art, or anything with a higher meaning. I could lean back and just enjoy watching the two characters change.I thought, when I saw what a low rating it had gotten here on IMDb, that it would really stink. But the story did appeal to me. I'm glad I watched it - I give it a 7/10, just because I enjoyed watching it. So my advice: watch it, but as usual, don't expect Oscar material.",7
885,"Predictable Screenplay, Supported by Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning","In New York City, Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is a spoiled wealthy immature young woman, living as if she were a princess in a fairy tale. Her father was a popular rock-and-roll guitar player, who died in a plane crash with Molly's mother when she was a little girl. On her birthday party in a nightclub, she meets Lorraine ""Ray"" Schleine (Dakota Fanning), a nasty young girl with attitudes of adult , living with her careless mother and a terminal father in a fancy uptown apartment. When the accountant of Molly vanishes with her US$ 100,000,000.00 inheritance, Molly is left with nothing but debts, and she needs to work to survive without having previous experience or any skills. She is hired to be Ray's babysitter, and their close contact makes Molly reach the maturity and Ray act like as a child of her age.""Uptown Girls"" has just a reasonable and predictable screenplay, being corny and boring sometimes, but supported by two of my favorite actresses: Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning. For me, they are the greatest attraction of this common flick and the reason why I bought the VHS. There are a few worthwhile moments along the story, the script has many flaws and this movie is only recommended to fans like me of these two great actresses. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Grande Menina, Pequena Mulher"" (""Big Girl, Small Woman"")",6
886,"Sue me, I fell for it (***)","This just goes to show you that you shouldn't go into movies with preconceptions, because I went in expecting (hoping, even) to hate this movie, and did for a while, but somewhere along the way it started working on me, and by the end I was practically eating out of its hand.
Molly Gunn (Brittany Murphy) is the rich, immature, hard-partying daughter of a deceased rock star, but when she loses all her money and belongings, she has to take a job as the nanny to a rich little girl named Ray (Dakota Fanning). Ray is very young, but acts like an uptight 45 year-old woman, because she's been ignored by her cold, socialite mother (a ""Melrose Place""-ish Heather Locklear). Both of these characters, but especially little Ray, are entirely fantasy creations. I don't care how self-sufficient she's had to be, no single-digit kid is going to act like this all the time and speak this kind of dialogue.
What makes the movie work is the actors. Murphy is a very likeable actress and with her mixture of raspy sexuality and innocent flakiness, I can't think of anyone who would have been better playing this spoiled rock princess. And as Ray, Dakota Fanning once again shows that she is one of the absolute best child actors out there. This is the third time in a row she's been the best part of the movie she's in (the other two being the irritating ""I Am Sam"" and the downright hideous ""Trapped""). Once her character begins to lighten up in the second half of the film, her performance really takes off.
So the story is very predictable, the dialogue often weak, and I hated the character of Molly's on-again, off-again ""rock star"" boyfriend (who inexplicably makes it big with a horrifyingly bad song about Egyptian cotton), but the characters played by Murphy and Fanning are a pleasure to spend time with, and that's what sold it to me.",6
887,Dismiss those other comments,"I will not attempt to prove that this movie should be ranked among the great movies, but I am more than willing to defend Uptown Girls against the mostly male haters. True, this movie could be deemed a 'chick flick', but why is that so unbelievably, unforgivably horrible? If you don't like movies with mostly female characters and even some slightly feminist themes, than you will not like this movie. I, on the other hand, watched this movie for the first time expecting the worst and most guilty kind of entertainment, and was more than pleasantly surprised by the dark tones and impeccable performances. I'm a harsh critic, and if you don't trust me, check out the link to Ebert's review of this film via 'external reviews'. Murphy and Fanning are a refreshing duo in a buddy film and like many female buddy films, Uptown Girls is unfairly abused and underrated. If you are trying to sound pretentious you probably shouldn't admit to liking this film. However, if you honestly found this film entertaining, and in some small respect, refreshing, you should admit the merit of this 'chick flick'. Murphy should be commended for choosing roles like Molly and her character in Little Black Book, because in a sea of fantasy and escapism there is an aspect of actual female representation written by women and made for women. Boys, if you want to win points with the ladies, stop letting your testosterone take over your actual pleasure gauge, and attempt to see the positive attributes of films such as this one. Trust me, it will do no good in the long run to hide your opinions on the basis of reputation and ornery stoic persuasion.",6
888,Poor little rich girls,"Boaz Yakin's ""Uptown Girls"" doesn't have anything new to say, but it offers us the perfect excuse to spend a mindless hour and a half in the company of Dakota Fanning, one of the best child actresses to come out of Hollywood in quite a while. If the viewer is looking for a light comedy, this film will do the trick.Molly Gunn, a spoiled young woman, finds out in the worst way she has been rendered destitute because of the man in charge of her trust fund has swindled it and ran away with all her money. She must face reality, so she takes the easy way out in trying for the job of being the little girl Ray's nanny. She is in for a rude awakening!Molly finds out that Ray is a grown woman trapped in a little girl's body. Ray is wise beyond belief. She makes Molly's life a living hell until Molly realizes that the little girl is to be pitied because she hasn't known any happiness in her short little life.The combination of Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning is what makes this film work. Both are fun to watch together. Both actresses show they have a strange chemistry that works on the screen. The supporting cast does its part, but of course, we can't take our eyes from Dakota Fanning.",7
889,"Way more than a shallow ""chick flick"" romcom","RELEASED IN 2003 and directed by Boaz Yakin, ""Uptown Girls"" is a dramedy with a little romance about Molly (Brittany Murphy), a fun-loving 22 year-old who suddenly loses her inherited riches and is forced to become a nanny to a stoical neat-freak girl, Ray (Dakota Fanning). Heather Locklear plays Ray's distant mother who's an exec in the music biz while Jesse Spencer plays a hunky musician who gets signed. Marley Shelton and Donald Faison are on hand as friends of Molly. The first act didn't do much for me, but at the halfway point something made me bust out laughing and I busted out four more times before it was over. More importantly, the movie is rich with quality mind/spirit food. Both Molly and Ray are broken people who handle their grief in opposite ways. And each has what the other needs to heal and escape their disorder.""Uptown Girls"" boldly reveals that ""meds"" (drugs) cannot heal or deliver a person; the best they can do is help a person cope. In fact, they usually have negative side-effects, mentally and physically. Sadly, six years after the release of the film Murphy ironically died of cardiac arrest due to inadvertent overdoses of a mixture of over-the-counter & prescription drugs taken (they presume) for a respiratory infection. She was only 32.The flick encourages growing up and achieving true success through (1.) recognizing ""golden connections"" and taking advantage of them (after all, no one makes it alone, no one; they had help); and (2.) discerning and cultivating one's special talent(s). I'd say more, but it's better to see the movie, enjoy it, and quarry the gems for oneself. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 32 minutes and was shot in New York City (Manhattan & Brooklyn with studio work done in Queens). WRITERS: Julia Dahl, Mo Ogrodnik & Lisa Davidowitz wrote the script based on Allison Jacobs' story. GRADE: B+",7
890,"Oh, you chick flicks!","Ah, chick flicks. How I hate thee. But surprisingly enough, I actually kind of enjoyed ""Uptown Girls"". It is such a girly girl movie, but it kind of wilts it's way into your heart. I had major doubts about watching this movie. I'm not really into Britney Murphy or Dakota Fanning, but this film is actually worth a watch. It's nothing I wouldn't buy, but something I wouldn't mind watching again. It reminds you of what is important in life and how scary it is to grow up. Cheesy, I know and very predictable. But you get into it and just let yourself go with it. After all, I did pay $3.00 to watch it. :D So, I would suggest a watch, it's a cute movie. Maybe I was just in a very good mood. I I what's happening? I never get into chick flicks! 7/10",7
891,A movie that makes you feel better and better....and better,"I actually saw this film by mistake, and couldn't help posting a comment here (which I actually think it's my first, but hey, it deserves it). I think it's a very thoughtful and sensitive movie, with plenty of funny but also moving scenes. Despite my better judgement, Brittany Murphy does a good job at playing the ""confused"" grown-up, while Dakota is a charming, if not absolutely fantastic grown-up ""in the making"". I think this movie is worth watching, at least, if not exclusively, for the terrific relationship between Ray and Molly. I had never expected to grow such fond of these ""Uptown Girls""....Watch it! It's worth your bucks!",10
892,It's been a long time,Just rewatched this classic. Brittany Murphy was so pretty. I miss her so much.,7
893,"It's cute, nothing more and nothing less","Everybody that knows Molly Gunn(Brittany Murphy) knows that she doesn't exactly act her age. She has never had a job, hardly cleans her apartment and sees the world through children's eyes(not to mention that she has a pig for a pet). But when her manager runs away and nobody is able to pay her bills, Molly is forced to get a job which turns out to be a babysitter to the very mature and jaded Ray(Dakota Fanning). Though at first, Molly and Ray don't get along, they slowly become good friends and teach each other how to act their age. This was a cute movie, nothing more and nothing less. The main reason that I enjoyed this movie was because of the incredibly adorable Ms.Fanning who is also an amazing actress. Brittany Murphy is a also a great actress but I think she should stop making sugary sweet comedies, they aren't really her thing. She is much better as the troubled mental patient. Anyways, even though this movie is sometimes misguided, it is still enjoyable and sweet. I would give Uptown Girls 6.5/10.",6
894,"Finally, The Best Comedy-Drama Growing Up Movie","17 August 2003. Uptown Girls ranks as one of the best comedy-drama motion pictures for the masses. The perfect blend of comedy and drama that has the sharp, biting, gut-roaring laughter along with the hard-hitting, emotional turmoil of pain and happiness. This movie deals about growing up in real terms, about facing death, about loss, about caring, about love, about family, about learning to have fun but also to become responsible. There is so much packed into this overall simple, comprehensive fairy tale yet poignant look into the soul movie. While not a box office winner because the guys will hate the movie (with little action and little sex), this female, mood-feeling movie hits just the best balance of laughter and serious script development (among the best that has come along FINALLY). This is what real film is all about...this film is the closest one can get (without becoming an independent film...without becoming cheesy, without trying to please everybody and losing its soul) to a great film in its girl-growing up romantic comedy genre (yet it really isn't about romance as much as becoming a whole person (young or old).Re-reviewed 1/4/2013. 8 from 9 rating.

895,Highly Recommended-Surprisingly Good,"Twenty-five years after the film ""Times Square"" we get an updated version of that New Wave classic. And like its predecessor, ""Uptown Girls"" is destined to be more appreciated twenty-five years later than it was by contemporary critics and audiences. Both films include terrific music that had people stopping at a store on the way home from the film to pick up the soundtrack album/CD (with ""soundtrack"" defined as songs by a collection of artists as compared to a more traditional musical score), both feature two scared girls-polar opposites who bond and help each other, both have Altman's cool ""Kansas City"" twist where the seemingly weaker girl becomes protective of the tough girl, both have absolutely perfect endings, and both take place in NYC.One major difference was that while ""Times Square"" had a clear target audience, ""Uptown Girls"" was never able to quite figure that out. While in almost every way superior to its sister film ""Raising Helen"", ""Uptown Girls"" lacks that films consistent family focus. Instead it is a fairy tale story marketed as a comedy, a generational bonding picture with just enough unnecessary adult material (a word here-an obscene gesture there) that it has a PG-13 rating; all of which means that adults think of it as a kid film and young viewers find only intermittent sequences to which they can relate.At least the film is consistent in its inconsistency, as Boaz Yakin's inspired and imaginative direction and many incongruously subtle script elements are paired with a contrived and predictable basic story. There is originality packaged inside unoriginality-Ray is not mad at Molly because she was not there when Ray's father died or because Molly was wrong about him living longer if Ray talked to him, she is mad because Molly convinced her to lower her defenses so his death her hurts more. All this disparity should work in ""Uptown Girls"" favor in a few years when the dust clears and the film finds its proper audience, one that appreciates its complex dichotomy and subtle nuances. Until then it is worth noting that this will be an important film historically. Film historians will look back on ""Uptown Girls"" as the feature where Brittany Murphy (Molly Gunn) really began to define the perceptive airhead persona she first developed in ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"". Roger Ebert sees a lot of the divine ineptitude of Lucille Ball in Murphy with both being magnets for ""Whoops! moments. I don't see her going quite that far, more like Zasu Pitts or Katherine Hepburn. Hollywood has gone two generations without an actress with this kind of natural comic talent. She and Dakota Fanning (Ray) play off each other very well.Music is central to the story since Molly's father was a rock legend who died in a plane crash when she was a young girl and Ray's mom runs a record label. Little Molly inspired her father to write a song about her before he died called ""Molly Smiles"". She inspires her boyfriend to write the song ""Sheets of Egyptian Cotton"", but does not want to hear her father's song. This sets up a somewhat predictable but otherwise perfect ending as you finally get to get to hear ""Molly Smiles"" at Ray's dance recital; the film is worth watching just for this scene (as good an ending as ""School of Rock's""). As someone commented earlier, the song works perfectly in the finale as all the plot threads are pulled together: "" (1) we get to hear ""Molly Smiles,"" (2) Neal makes up with Molly, (3) we find out what happened to Tommy Gunn's guitars, (4) Ray thanks Molly, (5) Ray finally dances free style, (6) Ray uses some moves she learned from Molly, and (7) Ray wears Molly's designer tutu. Appropriately, the soundtrack has a lot of the songs by female artists and makes for a pleasant enough album when you finally decide to play something else besides track 12. But you will probably pick this one up for the song about daddy's little girl because ""Nothing's wrong when Molly smiles."" Bottom line don't listen to the negative reviews-see this for yourself. If you can suspend belief and just accept the contrived basic story, then it won't be hard to really enjoy Brittany Murphy and Dakota Fanning as two broken kids who help each other learn how to live, 25 years after ""Times Square"".",8
896,Not a bad rental,"Altogether, it's an amusing film, but its overbearing sentimentality prevents it from really taking off.  Basically, if you've seen previews, you can pretty much predict the whole plot of the film.  Brittany Murphy is an irresponsible girl who suddenly has to face up to reality when she's evicted from her home, has to get a job babysitting a pampered rich girl (Dakota Fanning) who also has to face up to reality, and by the end Murphy becomes a responsible, mature person and Fanning loosens up and acts more like her age.  Blah, blah, blah.  There are moments of truth that work, despite spawning from cinematic contrivances.  There are in fact a lot of spoiled girls like Fanning's character, who get whatever they want simply because the mothers or fathers don't want to deal with them.  That's also why I wish the film could've developed Heather Locklear's character more thoroughly, since she's the reason why her daughter acts the way she does.  But the film does have a lot of contrivances that are corny and predictable, which is why I give it merely an above-average rating.  Plus, Fanning's snooty sarcasm gets terribly annoying at times.  I always hated watching that moment in all the previews where she'd say ""News-fe-lash!""  All in all, ""Uptown Girls"" is a fluffy, superficial feel-good comedy that doesn't fail to entertain, and I will recommend it for a rental.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",6
897,"Excellent, hilarious, and witty film that will make you feel good","In my opinion, UPTOWN GIRLS is an excellent, hilarious, and witty film that will make you feel good. If you ask me, Ray (Dakota Fanning) was a pure bratty b****! This was because of the way she treated Molly (Brittany Murphy) most of the time. Also, as far as I could see, Molly really did need to get a life. When I noticed that Heather Locklear was in this, I was pleasantly surprised. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent, hilarious, and witty film that will make you feel good to all you Brittany Murphy fans who have not seen it. You're in for a good time if you haven't seen it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",10
898,Fanning make the movie worth your time,"The movie as you might of heard is not excellent but it is far from bad.  It was cute but a little risque for the younger audience.  This is not a child's film it is for late teens to adults.  You are warned if you read why it is rated PG-13.  I thought that Murphy's part was very good.  I'm sure there are many people out there that have not yet grown up b/c their parents gave them everything and this kind of shows what would happen to those people if mommy and daddy were not around anymore.  As for Dakota she is going to be one of the new Child Star's who make it for a while.  She has yet another movie releasing this year called the ""Cat in the Hat"" and I will surely watch it.  Although this is a straight chic flic I really do watch everything and was pleasantly surprised with this film.  If you have a chance check this film out.",6
899,Boaz Yakin is my cup of tea,"Boaz Yakin is someone I've been following since he wrote and directed 1994's FRESH, which is one of the best films I've ever seen. None of his subsequent projects have had the power of that movie but I'm an unbelievably loyal Leo, and I will keep seeing anything the man writes and/or directs.This one, Uptown Girls, is directed by Yakin, and it does display his knack for getting decent interaction from his performers; there are some extremely believable scenes between Murphy and Fanning, in particular, who both manage, under his direction and thanks to their innate talent (especially the soon-to-be-legendary Fanning's), to breathe genuine life into their potentially one-dimensional characters.I hadn't read anything about the movie beforehand, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it play out not as a farce but rather as a skewed and quirky buddy movie, with both characters learning from each other what it means to be human, at any age. Good use of subordinate characters as well, and although the film is hardly a masterpiece by any stretch, it most definitely has its heart in the right place.",6
900,A good dramedy.,"This is actually a nine or eight star film if you are open to it.The critics have lost their capacity to enjoy films, much like the Fanning character in the movie. But, for them, sadly, there is no redemption. Fanning is brilliant, every time she opens her mouth she touches your heart. Murphy is very good, and as one IMDb user has written, ""adults probably wrote it off as a 'kids movie' and the kids didn't understand the emotional plot line""....interesting explanation as to why the film did only 37 million domestically.Who is the audience for this film? What age? Women, from fourteen to thirty, probably. The only fault I can think of is it moves too fast to get to the story, and a few more nuances would have made it a little more palpable. I liked this film.",8
901,Just Another Chick Flick,"Uptown Girls does have its moments but in the end it's a disappointment. Molly Gunn is the spoiled, freewheeling daughter of a late rock legend. However, when her inheritance is stolen by her manager, Molly is forced to get a job. She becomes a nanny to Ray Schleine, an ""eight-year-old going on forty"" who lives with her mother. Ray has grown up with a revolving door of nannies and too little stability. Molly and Ray both feel painfully alone in the world, but as they try to make their new arrangement work, each discovers in the other a true friend. The plot sounds interesting and with two fine actresses this could have been a really good film. The story turned out to be weak though as there was really nothing new about it. The film was also really predictable and it was really no fun to watch. Yes, there were some funny moments and some touching moments but you don't really feel for the characters as most are selfish and annoying. I thought it was going to be a good film as Brittany Murphy is a good actress. A lot of people don't like her but I think she has talent and will one day become a huge star. She did a decent job in this film but this isn't her best performance. Dakota Fanning did a good job of playing a really annoying character and she really is a good actress. The rest of the actors don't really matter as the film mainly focuses on Dakota and Brittany. Though some actresses worth mentioning that have smaller roles are Heather Locklear and Marley Shelton. Boaz Yakin does a decent job of directing again nothing special. I think the story turned out to be a little unrealistic, which is okay. But, sometimes it would become too much to take seriously. Also, some of those serious scenes were actually funny not because of lousy acting but because of cheesy dialog. It really did turn into one big cliché film which I wasn't expecting. This movie could have been more then just some regular chick flick but after a promising start it quickly goes somewhere we have been before. At least its short so that help matters but it also means the story is rushed. Despite how much I like Brittany Murphy, I just can't recommend this film but it its better then Just Married. In the end, this is another chick flick that's only worth watching if you are a die-hard fan of Dakota or Brittany. If you're not then just skip this movie. Rating 5.4/10",4
902,My god this was just...boring...painful.,Mickey Rourke routinely mispronounces name after name. Caligula becomes Caliglia. Parthians becomes Parthinians. And he mispronounces Paetus as Paiteus throughout THE ENTIRE FILM. Nobody took the time to correct him? Or is he just an unreachable knucklehead?The special effects are cartoonish. The music is out of place. I don't think there are ever more than 4 people in a single scene at the same time in the entire film! The budget for this must have been less than the price of a fully loaded Hyundai Elantra. Some decent drone shots of cliff climbing. The main character obviously worked hard throughout the production. But...I cannot believe I spent $7.99 renting this. I should flagellate myself for this unforgivable mistake.,1
903,Rare that a film can be so bad at EVERYTHING.,"A) The dialogue is wooden and stilted throughout. Every line is clumsy exposition in awkward prose.
b) The characters are one-dimensional sketches that exist only as cogs to forward a flat narrative. The much maligned Mickey Rourke is at least amusing as he slurs and glowers his way through his horribly overwritten lines, but there's no hint of a an actual character in there, just a tissue of tics and mannerisms stitched together. And he's the MOST interesting of the lot.
c) The directing and editing feel like the work of a not especially gifted film student; pedestrian, unimaginative, and designed to drain this flat narrative of any possible interest or excitement. Long minutes of a guy walking/running across hills/mountains/rivers/deserts.
d) In several scenes, the director lingers on a shot or a location in a way that suggests that something interesting is finally going to happen. And then...it doesn't. Not an ounce of excitement in the fights or the chase.
e) Spoiler: here's a plot summary to save yourself ninety minutes for squeezing blackheads or something less painful than watching this movie.
Scene: Grumpy Roman General, mumbling to self: Boy, I sure am pissed at Nero. He shoulda just sent me to Armenia. I hope those guys that he DID send all die.
Scene: Trapped Roman General to hero: Look, we need you to climb a cliff, run across mountains and deserts, and get Grumpy Roman General to come and save us.
Scene: Hero climbs cliff with much tribulation, runs and runs and runs and runs, meeting a few uninteresting characters who never actually get developed, and gets to Grumpy Roman General's palace.
Scene: Hero: Hey, come and rescue our guys.
Grumpy Roman General: No.
Grumpy Roman General's cute mistress: Oh, come on. Go rescue them.
Grumpuy Roman General: Oh, ok.End.Hero: Okay.",1
904,Representative,"This is quite simply unwatchable. The state of decline of Mickey Rourke, whose opening line is a pathetic mispronunciation of ""Caligula"" - ""Caliglia,"" slurs Rourke - seems somehow to mirror the decline of the entire industry, perhaps of the country as a whole. What little of this I was able to sit through is bad in that grotesque way only a culture in the throes of total disintegration can produce.",1
905,Don't waste an hour and a half of your life!,"It's not often that I really criticise a movie, but this movie is utter dross.From first minute to last, dross. Who thought it was a good idea to cast Mickey Rourke as a Roman general? He sounds like a punch-drunk Rocky doing an impersonation of Rod Steiger. Terrible casting.The acting was as wooden as the trees in the Armenian forests. The editing and continuity were beyond bad. I mean, really, terrible. When the lead was scaling the cliffs, the continuity was all over the place. He was all over the rock face every 30 seconds, with the same sequence being reused several times, even though he'd moved on to a different section of the cliff just moments earlier.The fight scenes were pathetic. The Asian woman cast as Rourke's mistress could hardly speak a word of English and mangled the lines badly.The only one to come out of it with any credit was the actress playing Doria, the Armenian girl who helped the lead when he was lost in the mountains.Seriously, don't waste your time.",1
906,Mind Numbing Bad,"I lost an hour and a half of my life watching this drivel. From poor directing, acting, confusing plot, lines that are beyond bad... I need to find a way to remove this ""movie"" from my memories. Two stars because I am in a generous mood.",2
907,Too boring to be a fun watch,"First to say, for a very low budget no-name film, I was highly impressed by the attention to detail in terms of historical accuracy. Set in the early Roman Empire during the reign of Nero, it depicts a legion being trapped in enemy territory in Armenia.The main character is a Roman auxiliary, Noreno, originally from Hispania and he is sent on a mission by general Paetus to get a message to Corbulo to send his own legion to try to break them out.
Noreno is accompanied by another Hispanian auxiliary. Noreno is played by an Irish guy with a thick Irish accent but apparently this is explained in him being raised in Britannia for a long while. His Hispanian companion speaks Spanish (modern spanish).
As well, the Armenians are described as having support from the Parthians, and a large number of Scythian mercenaries. Impressively to me, much of the ""bad guys"" hunting after Noreno, due to being played by very european looking guys, are dressed and described as being Scythian. One of them even calls his superior ""Saka"", a name for a steppe tribe neighboring to the Scythians.
This attention to cultural detail is rather amazing overall, and it feels bad just how thoroughly wasted it is on such a boring film.
The low budget shows pretty hard in the scenes involving the Roman generals, but the majority of the film takes place in vast empty woods and hills, filmed somewhere in Spain or something. It feels a lot like some 80% of this film consisted of a film crew filming some guys hiking and swordfighting in the Spanish mountains.
Mickey Rourke is so completely disconnected from the film that it genuinely feels like his role was added after the fact and filmed months or even a year after the rest of the film was completed.
He plays his role surprisingly well as a disgruntled grizzled old general. Unfortunately his role is almost entirely him droning on ranting and raving at a bust of Nero, telling old soldiers' tales and the like.
As well, somewhat humorously, he proceeds to constantly mispronounce various names, such as turning ""Parthians"" into ""Parthinians"" and ""Paetus"" into ""Patitius"" or something. The fact that literally every other character in the film who speaks these names pronounces them properly either means no one cared enough to stop him and correct him or they were otherwise intimidated for some reason.
Further adding to the sense of disconnect in Mickey Rourke's scenes, near the end of the film he is abruptly contradicting everything he was ranting and yelling at a bust of Nero about, before being talked out of his bad decision by his Yuezhi mistress, played by Bai Ling for all of about 4 minutes.
On top of being boring, the film at some points seems to have been badly edited. At one point we're shown Noreno on his own, escaping some Scythians hunting him, and he runs into another Roman auxiliary scout. The next scene shows him at a campfire with this other Roman, and with a previously unmentioned Hispanian auxiliary (the spanish speaking guy). He then has a flashback of the Roman auxiliary scout and the Hispanian guy being killed in battle, despite them being alive and at the campfire with him.Then Noreno is off on his own, with absolutely no mention of these other two with him, or of any battle that took place between him escaping the Scythians and making camp.
On top of all this, the biggest insult is that in a movie called ""The Legion"", at no point do we ever get to see the legion in question.",1
908,Mickey Rourke phones it in again.,"Mister Rourke speaks in the beginning of the movie.
Mister Rourke speaks somewhere in the middle of the movie.
Mister Rourke speaks at the end of the movie.

"" here.. say these lines and we will splice you into the movie so we can add your name to the cast and hope it draws paying customers..""
don't waste your time.",1
909,Where to Begin....Caligula not Caliglia.,"The movie starts off with Mickey Rourke as Roman General Corbulo mispromouncing the name of Caligula Caesar as Caliglia...and then it gets worse. Some bad digital effects fly by and soon Noreno, an Auxiliary Cohort is sent on a mission over the Armenian mountains with two accomplices in order to seek help from General Corbulo while trying to evade the men who are after him.The digital effects are bad. The acting is mediocre although some of the lesser known faces try their best. There is hardly any character development but then again most of the characters are expendable and writing a decent script probably took too much time. Annoyingly, the accomplices are killed in the first 20 minutes and only then is some interaction shown between them and Noreno in a flashback. But since they were already killed off its impossible to feel any emotional attachment to the characters.The editing gets very choppy during the fighting, falling and running scenes and some of the kills are done off screen probably in order not to have to worry about doing any practical or computer effects. There is also a 4 minute climbing scene which feels it was there just to fill in screen time. And there are other scenes like this that are just padding with Noreno running for three minutes then running again for a few more. The character of Noreno is also probably the worst Roman soldier ever since he gets captured and beaten at least 3 times and this is not even by the men chasing him but random thugs.The monologues by General Corbulo spread out through the movie don't do much for the film but there are glimpses of what a great actor Mickey Rourke once was and he clearly has more acting ability then most of the other cast members. One more thing, seeing as Corbulo was the brother in law of Caligula he more than likely knew his name, but this and other mispronouncing mistakes really make me think that some of the actors might have been drunk or didn't care much during filming. Alas, watching the result is not a great way to spend an hour and thirty minutes. A possible 3 out of 10.",3
910,Sooooooo BaaaaaaaD!!,"Well, I literally set up an IMDB account to review this one movie. I hope it's the last time I feel compelled to do so. Here goes.I'm genuinely shocked how bad it is. I kinda feel for some of the up and coming talent who will have this on their filmography.I recommend just trying to watch 30mins but if you manage the whole thing without turning inside out in a succession of ""This is Soooo Baaad!"" Cringe Spasms then you're not paying much attention or you're dead..The Climbing scene is a continuity nightmare I still can't figure out which mountain he's climbing..The fight scenes are ridiculousMucky Rourke embarrasses himself with mispronunciations of Roman names..I kept looking across the sofa at my girlfriend we both couldn't believe what was actually happening, she wanted to turn it off but I held her hand firmly in mine and look her in the eye and said ""We can do this if we stick together we can make it through"" ;)This movie may get cult status as with all the lockdown going on people will be more inclined to take a dive into the unknown. Beware tho if you do, it will take you deep, deeper than you ever knew you could go..I feel bad for hating on this as some people will actually have put some genuine effort into it, but it's just poorly directed.. Sorry José Stick to being a producer..I still don't know what on Earth was going on maybe I should watch it again..If you're with someone and you want them to dump you I'd whack this on and tell them it's you're favourite film of all time, whilst watching it keep reaffirming how great it is. It won be long before they leave you...Anyways as they old saying goes ""Can't knock a trier"" or maybe you can in this case.Enjoy:)",1
911,If I could give this a 0 I would.,"Painful to watch, terrible camera work, terrible Special effects. They can't even get the names/pronunciation right. I'm pretty sure my nephew could create something better on minecraft.",1
912,Nope - this is a miss - boring,"I am a huge Mickey Rourke fan. He needs to retire. I remember watching the commercial for this, just a monologue by Mr. Rourke; I was thinking that the actual movie must be better than that because it was muddled and he seemed drunk. Nope. the movie is just that bad. It spends most of the film showing a man hike through the woods. Sure, he's suppose to be on a mission to save a Roman Legion but still, it is a boring nature walk that shouldn't have taken 45 minutes. And Rourke seems to stumble through his scenes. The life-time of drugs and plastic surgery and boxing have taken away his ability to speak clearly. He suppose to be the ultimate warrior but he seems to have trouble walking across a room and sitting on a stool. The special effects are B-movie quality. This is just unwatchable. Sorry, MIckey.",2
913,Seriously!!?,How do you pay for a cast like this and then hire someone so incompetent on camera!? Awful effects awful editing. Turned off after 20mins,1
914,I wanted to like it,This movie is a subject matter I like so I gave it a shot but wow.My biggest issue is Mickey Rourke. He fumbles through his lines while reading them off a teleprompter. He's wearing fake eye lashes on one eye and has manicured nails. He looks ridiculous.The filmmakers must have really struggled with him. They had an idea in mind and they went for it. In many scenes the other actors give it their all which is why I gave this a 4.The effects aren't great. I can forgive that. The action is okay. I can forgive that.Mickey Rourke ruins the whole thing. He obviously can't even memorize a few lines now. I hope they didn't pay him too much. He clearly didn't prepare and was probably a nightmare to work with.,4
915,Better to chew on broken glass than to watch this movie.,"I'm a fan of movies, a huge fan. I'm a newspaper editor and an author and I always look for the good in everything. There is always a positive to be found and I even like some of the under-the-radar-rarely-watched movies.
But this movie can make me a pessimist in a heartbeat. It was just downright terrible. This was director Jose' Magan's first experience behind the lens and his first experience at writing. If he were in college, he'd get an ""F"" and probably be required to repeat every class from kindergarten through grad school. As a producer, none of his movies from The Malevolent to Stranded have fared well at all.
But, Magan wasn't the only one mixing the batter. Pedro Santamaria also ventured into the world of story writing and writing screenplays. It was his first attempt and if he should learn anything, it's that you need someone in the room with you who says, ""Don't do that. It's a bad idea.""
The premise is that a young legionnaire and his legion are trapped by a superior force. The superior force gives the legion 3 days to surrender. The general believes they can stall them 7 days, giving the young legionnaire time to go for help across mountains and deserts. Yet even if he mad the trip in 7 days, it would take a relief force several additional days to come to the rescue since 1,000 men move slower than 1 man. But, that's just a technicality. So the legion would have to delay that final surrender by at least a fortnight.
Mickey Roarke plays General Corbulo (based on the ancient Roman general). In his command tent, he has a bust of Nero that he constantly talks to. And it just gets stranger. He also wears heavy makeup. And he wears an eye path over his left eye. And sometimes he doesn't wear that eye patch. And that eye is actually fine, so why the patch? No reason given. Then there is Corbulo's French Manicure... Yep, it's a beautiful manicure, especially for a crazy man who wears way too much makeup and cries while talking to his bust of Nero.
I would critique the acting, but there actually isn't any ""true"" acting in the movie. Magan must have given the instruction, ""I want everyone to be as morose and sad as they can possibly be.""
The movie's ship was sunk before filming ever began. The story was shoddy. The screenplay is worse. The direction was non-existent. There is a reason directors don't get always get to do their pet projects. The movie wasn't ""artsy."" It was just bad. The legionnaire running for help, Noreno (Lee Partridge) doesn't do a bad job, but he doesn't do a great job, either. This was his 7th movie, all subpar, and his second movie under Magan.
Boa-Ling played an advisor to Mickey Rourke's Corbulo. Her performance is straight out of a 1980s Conan or Beastmaster movie. And it should be sent back in time to those movies. Her performance is ludicrous.
I honestly put this in my top 3 worst movies of all time. It's horrendous from the directing to the acting to the producing to the writing. This movie didn't hit on any cylinders and is better relegated to the burn pit.
The story is lumpy and never has a flow to it. It's just terrible.",1
916,Watching a fly on a wall would be more interseting.,Really.....Lads....there is an hour and a half of my life i will not get back! and the girlfriends too and she even hit me over the head with the cushion when it was over for putting on the load of tripe! watching turf dry out in the bog would have been more interesting than that load of you know what....as the other comment said..painful well it sure was painful!Dont get hit with a cushion! watch something else!,1
917,Terrible,"One of the worst movies I have seen in my entire life. M. Rourke look like a clown with artificial eyelashes and nails, Poor dialouge. Crap story. If wanted to watch beautiful scenery would instead go to Discovery Channel!",1
918,The worst movie of the year,"The movie is bad on a very low budget, it has a very basic plot and bad performances.
It is so low budget that they use CGI for almost everything, because they only hired 10 actors ...
Basically it's about a guy who runs all the time.
The only good thing is the natural mountain landscapes. Everything else is for oblivion",1
919,Nothing about this is good,"Script, is rambling incongruent overly simplified. Character development doesn't exist. It reaches for a great place but it is not in the vicinity of good. The jumping editing leaves one wondering just what they were attempting.
I hope every person in this gets better. Mickey won't thoughfor him I just wish peace and an ability to stay off screens.",1
920,A Joke,"A bloke running through the mountains!
And Mickey O'Rourke nice accent not!
It says this movie is based on real events I don't think so.
Rome was at war with Parthia and the general in charge was called Carbulo that is the only true things in this movie.",1
921,Rourke didn't deserve such a horrendos film!!,"This is atrocious! I have watched many bad films with Rourke, but this one is in the Top 5 bad list.80% of the film is filled with an idiot running and running through hills, forests, deserts, rivers. No horses, no Roman legion are showed in the film, probably due to the extremely low budget. The camera work is terríble and the cinematography is ugly! The few lines in the script are ridículous, to say the least!Mickey Rourke is one of my favorite actors and It is so sad to see him wasted in things like that! His character looks more like an old female indian than a Roman general.I think is time to retire, Mickey...",1
922,"A magnificent work of art, or the worst movie of our generation?","Just finished watching this movie, and it was VERY inspiring. Well, it was so bad that it inspired me to sign up for an IMDB account just to post a review.The movie itself left me with so many feelings. Motion sickness, confusion, general bewilderment, just to list a few. Mickey's performance was absolutely atrocious, from the mispronunciation of the easiest of names, to the fake eyelashes and french manicured nails, I have never laughed so hard at a non comedy. What was with the eye patch!? At one point he had it lifted from his eye and then started crying. So did he need the eye patch, or was it just a fashion accessory? I'm so confused. Here's my theory on how the eye patch was introduced to the wardrobe.Mickey: ""I think I'm going to wear an eye patch""
Producer: ""but why?""
Mickey: ""It will add so much to the character persona""
Producer: ""what are you going to do with it during the crying scene?""
Mickey: ""I will just lift it above my eye, and then bring it back down later""
Producer: ""Mickey, I don't think this is going to work""
Mickey: ""oh it will work, I'm wearing it""Aside from Mickey's noteworthy performance, the rest of the movie follows a man that can't seem to stay on his feet. Cue frantic camera work to make sure you get that nauseating feeling in the pit of your stomach. The scenery in the movie was nice. Great scenes of a man stumbling through the forest, a man stumbling through mountains, a man falling in river, and my favourite, a man stumbling through the desert.My wife isn't a movie watcher, she mainly reads on her iPad while I watch movies. But even she looked up from her screen and said, ""What are you watching, this is terrible, please turn it off"". However, like a bad accident, I couldn't look away.If you want to infuriate your friends and family, I suggest that you recommend this movie under the guise of a quality ""must watch"" film.It did keep most of my attention for an hour and a half, so I guess the jokes on me.",1
923,My kingdom for a horse.......,"Could've been good. Decent enough rescue story, 61-63 AD (Tacitus) about messenger trying to break through to Roman General Corbulo in Syria from Gen. Paetus, desperate after encirclement at mountainous Tigranocerta, Armenia. Bit like a small town repertory company trying to screen a Blockbuster. Not enough Dollars for a Horse. Would've given a 7 to see a famous reverse-arrow Parthian archer on camel-back. Must've been after they charged the White Walkers - right?",6
924,Terrible beyond words,"Film continuity wrong, acting wrong, music wrong.
Do something more interesting like watching a tap drip !",1
925,Necessary message,"The staging and acting was very convincing. The message of this story was necessary. Alas there's an imbalance in pace. The pace from the beginning until the guys are finally picked up from the desert really helps to feel what actually happens. Towards the end it felt like the makers suddenly found out that the story had to end and that this had to be quick. That also contributed to the fact that I lost my understanding of some of the details of all the politics behind the scenes. If I wouldn't have felt that way near the end of the movie, I would have rated it a 10! Still, the essentials of the message was clear.",8
926,Check that out...,"I loved watching Air here in Germany, because it's a whole different movie compared to the stuff that we usually get to see from Hollywood or the East Coast. I think the director did a great job combining talented staff from the Midwest with a fun story and some very sweet details. I can only recommend buying the DVD or sharing it with friends, especially if you are bored by all the blockbusters. Also to notice: The music of the film is just amazing and the main characters fit their themes very well. The dance scenes are great, especially the one with all the paint really fascinated me. How many different ideas all packed together in this outburst!! Just great work! Nice movie, thumbs up! : )",9
927,"""Air: The Musical"" smart and fun","Not usually a musical nut, but this one is so smart and fun with great music! The film has a good pace and keeps moving; some musicals can drag and struggle with pace, but not this one . Great character development and plot turns and parallels keep your interest. The music and choreography are well matched, which is difficult with the wide range of musical genres utilized. ""Air: The Musical"" shows what potential these young indie film makers have... I look for more great things from them in the future. The creativity they exhibit in this work may some day be seen setting the standard for films of the dramatic genre for years to come. Don't miss this GREAT film!",9
928,AIR is a timeless story,"AIR was a wonderful reminder of the complexity and simplicity relationships bring to life. The young leads are mature beyond their years in this performance. One of the highlights for me was the range in genre of the score. There's rock, folk, country - you name it and something for everyone's taste. And the music strengthens the emotion throughout the story line. For their first feature film, Jeremy Osbern and Chris Blunk have created a high quality, timeless story that all generations can relate to and enjoy. In fact, part of the subtle charm of the film is that it obviously hasn't been staged in the obvious Hollywood spots. The streets and scenes should remind us all of places we live, making the movie more relevant for viewers.",9
929,A Refreshingly Delightful Musical,"AIR the Musical comes highly recommended. Certainly, it does not disappoint. AIR the Musical is a refreshingly delightful movie experience. In an era when many fashionable movies are founded upon mind-numbing special effects and tiresome plots, AIR the Musical is an alluring departure from the uninspiring norm. Indeed, it successfully integrates warmly realistic story lines with exhilarating original music, offering big screen entertainment in a captivating and graceful manner. This unforgettable independent film touches the heart and charms the musical senses. An authentic classic, AIR the Musical is a DVD that belongs in everyone's collection. You will come back to it, again and again. Hopefully, the movie sound track will be available soon.",9
930,Extraordinary AIR,"The movie/musical AIR is astonishingly well made. The casting, filming, screenplay, acting, and most importantly, original music knit fascinating life stories together, and move viewers to celebrate life and believe in a better future. Kansas University must be proud for educating/preparing the team involved in making the original production, AIR. These young film makers have great futures ahead. So... will there be a sequel? I can only hope AIR II, AIR III, and AIR IV will continue to explore the depths of interesting, personal, loving relationships. See the movie AIR. Buy the movie AIR,and see it again and again. You will never be disappointed. I know, and I am very happy with AIR, and more than satisfied each time I enjoy this wonderful film.",9
931,"Musical, Whimsical and Intriguing - Hmmmmmm","Thoroughly enjoyable musical. Cast is young, veritably unknown and stellar. Numerous ""fun"" symbolic musical tributes if you watch closely. Certainly worth watching more than once to catch the deeper meanings (and puns) of the vignettes. If you are looking for an evening with fun, music, laughter and love - this movie is well worth considering - would work well as a conversation piece for a gathering of your friends. **** 1/2 stars out of 5 - only one scene seemed a little ""long"", and that is probably due to the extended use of the chest-cam - otherwise, this musical will capture your attention to the end. Buy it or see it at the theater - it's a keeper.",9
932,A Major Disappointment,"I watched this movie because it had 10 5-star ratings on Amazon.com with no lower ratings attached. Boy, was I let down.The script had potential, but was poorly executed. It's three stories in one movie, and it isn't until the last scene that two of the stories kind of come together (although there's doubt about that). Each story on its own would have been interesting had it been more fleshed out. Only one of the stories had any reason to have any sort of musical theme tied to it, and it was that story that made the best (although, still sub-par) use of the music.The acting left so much to be desired. For a short while, I wondered if the director had used non-actors as the stars of the movie for a reason. It wasn't until halfway through the movie that I realized these were just bad actors, not non-actors. If not for a screen writing credit, I'd assume that this movie was entirely improvised by a troupe of actors in a beginners acting class.The music was OK. I doubt it would ever win any awards or sell any soundtracks. It was music that an amateur writer would throw together, and I have to wonder if this movie wasn't made just for the purpose of showcasing the film makers attempt at writing music.The singing was just plain bad. There were a couple of scenes where the singing was OK, but for the most part, not one actor could carry a tune. One actor in particular couldn't hold a note in just one song.There was only one scene in the entire movie that was remotely worth watching again. It was a dance scene with no singing, involving ""tap"" and spilled paint (an homage to Singing in the Rain?). This is the ONLY reason I was generous enough to give this 2-stars instead of one.Again, all of the 5-star reviews that have been given simply had to have been written by people involved with the movie. Don't waste your money on this one. If you get a chance to pick it up for free at the local library or get it from Redbox for $1, give it a try, then PLEASE come back here and rate it so that others aren't fooled into buying it due to reviews or ratings planted by the film maker.",1
933,Excellent,"An original musical score with an excellent plot. If you enjoy independent film and want to be entertained this is a selection you must make. You actually need to watch it a couple of times to catch all of the subtle humor embedded in the film as well. These days Glee seems to have reached out to many. If you like music integrated into a story this is a film for you. With all of the lack of originality in major motion pictures it is refreshing to see creativity in an independent setting. If you are from the Midwest and familiar with Kansas City you should also enjoy trying to identify some of the films locations in KC, Lawrence and Topeka to name a few! If you enjoy a variety of music styles this would appeal to you as well. Possibly you will want to check out Steve Unruh's music after watching this selection.",10
934,A great modern day musical,"A perfectly directed modern day rock musical with songs you soon won't get out of your head. Everything about this film is beautiful from the shooting to the story. It's one of those films that you watch and you feel like you've experienced something special. If you are a fan of the cinema then you will for sure love this gem. The acting is fantastic. The music is amazing and it's emotionally charged. Every moment of this film is so well thought out from the music to the dancing to the production design. I recently watched this film with my wife, seven-year-old nephew, and my thirteen-year-old brother and everyone enjoyed it. Jeremy Osbern has created an instant cult classic!",10
935,"Real history, with no heroes","The movie shows who has been the man Joaquim behind the character Tiradentes who entered Brazilian History. To say more, the film shows what was Brazil in colonial times. Mud, blood, sweat, slaves, natural chats, blacks, natives, mestizos, Portugueses, power relations. Camera does not show the distant sight of historian, but, moving, it throws spectator in that real Brazil which does not make Brazilians proud, in spite of gorgeous cinematography. Even though the story is romanticized, this is a real History, with no heroes. Slavery was the rule, corruption and exploitation were the way things happened. Blacks and Indians were not much more than oxen or horses, although human relations could have various paths and their position could change according them. Direction is amazing, as the film shows impressive control from innovative filmmaking to quite natural speaking in good dialogues.",9
936,"Not brilliant by all means, but a nice watch","I have seen a fair few comparisons to the 1967 film with Rex Harrison, now I saw the 1967 film as a kid and kind of liked it but it is something I need to re-watch. This film is basically a remake, minus the songs, and while it isn't brilliant and no masterpiece in any shape or form, it does have its good things. The film's plot is very slight, and the script has its weak spots while having some funny ones as well. And there is sometimes uneven pacing and direction. But it is nicely filmed, and the music is nice enough. The acting was also pretty good. Eddie Murphy does a serviceable job as John Dolittle, his role is not really like the ones he had in Beverly Hills Cop or Trading Places which also happens to two of his better movies, but he does well, and I will say he has been worse and he's been in worse films too. Kyla Pratt looks lovely and acts nicely as Maya, and Ossie Davis is good as well. The voice cast carry the picture as the animals who (along with the above average effects) steal the show. Consisting of the likes of Garry Shandling, John Leguizamo and Gilbert Gottfried they do great jobs, however Oliver Platt and Peter Boyle have little to do. Overall, a nice watch but nothing exceptional. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6
937,Not half bad and lots of small quirks that will make you smile,"Doctor Dolittle (1998)I was surprised to see this movie got such a low rating—it's not so bad. Oh, for sure it's not so great, either. But Eddie Murphy alone makes it something worth watching (he's one of the few perfect-pitch comedians out there). And the story, a 1920 classic for children, is something of its own.What falls apart is the slightly pushy sentimentalism and the generally mediocre secondary cast. That might be enough to push it into mediocrity, for sure, but it's not meant to be a deep classic, and it plays with the story nicely.That story is not just about a doctor (of the human type) who can hear animals talking. It's more about how society condemns hims and tries to help him with psycho-care. His bland wife (with the gorgeous eyes that get overplayed) is typical of his ""friends,"" all nice people with distractions and no time for the possibility that he might, in fact, hear animals talk.The talking animals are of course great fun, from the rats to the tiger. This is the part of the movie that is meant to appeal across the board, and it does, including its good special effects. The feeling of family, not dysfunctional, is another bit of warmth, not to mention that the family is African American, a nice twist on the original story based on an English doctor.And though the movie was not liked by critics, it has made a third of a billion dollars, which speaks for itself. Not a masterpiece, and not even a classic, it still has wonderful aspects including a very wonderful basic concept.",6
938,The ultimate feel-good film,"One of my favorite kid movies from my childhood and still love it! It's hilarious, heartwarming, amusing lines, and solid plot. Eddie Murphy is gold like many of his roles! I absolutely love all the animals they're so endearing and funny. Doctor Dolittle is underrated too, I'm probably one of very few that is enlightened by this movie.",10
939,"""Doctor Dolittle"" does a lot with Chris Rock","OK, so ""Doctor Dolittle"" is mostly stuff that would only appeal to little kids, but it is worth seeing (I've actually never seen the original version, which I heard was a pathetic excuse for a movie). Eddie Murphy is, in my opinion, trounced in the movie by Chris Rock as the out-of-control hamster. I almost wish that they could have had more scenes with both Eddie Murphy and Ossie Davis (yes, Ossie Davis went so far as to take a role in this movie).So, this movie's nothing special, but pretty funny nonetheless. Also starring Oliver Platt, Peter Boyle, Richard Schiff, and the voices of Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres (who would later co-star as the voices in ""Finding Nemo"").",6
940,nice family movie,"Dr. John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) can talk to the animals. He used to talk to his dog as a kid, but his father forced him to stop and sent away his dog. He has denied his ability ever since, and is now a family man and a doctor. Then he starts hearing voices from animals.Norm MacDonald does a great voice as the dog. It would be better to have a buddy comedy with the dog. Eddie Murphy has good chemistry with him. The other outstanding voicework is Chris Rock who does the gerbil Rodney.It's a generally a nice family movie with some crude humor. It works on that level. Just don't expect more. The potty humor may offend the parents, but there isn't anything to be concerned about.",6
941,To his credit Murphy let's the animals have their say while he plays straight man to their lines,"`Doctor Dolittle'.  ***.  (1998, USA, PG-13, 85 min. Directed by Betty Thomas with Edie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Richard Schiff, Kristen Wilson, Kyla Pratt).  John Dolittle (Murphy) can talk to the animals and they can talk to him.  At least he/they could when he was a kid.  His dad thought he was nuts and though the use of an exorcist and some stern fatherly persuasion John looses or suppresses his talent/curse. When we next see John, he is Dr. Dolittle, M.D, happily married, father of two girls. He's a respected partner in a very successful medical practice and is about to become very rich.  He and his partners are about to sell to an HMO. Everything seems to be going great until Dr. Dolittle almost gets into a car accident with a dog.  A bump on his head brings back the voices.  Is he going nuts, are life's stresses too much, or does Dr. John just need to find his inner child?The rest is a rather silly man-gets-in-touch-with-soul type movie, except for the animals.  They have all the good lines.  There's the lascivious German shepherd that can't control himself even when he's pleading his reformation on the way to being clipped.  The pigeon couple; she's a nag, he's a wimp.  There are the quarreling rats, the neurotic terrier, the tiger, and of course Lucky, the dog Dr. Dolittle hit in the car accident. To his credit Murphy let's the animals have their say while he plays straight man to their lines.  One other thing about Murphy's acting; Dr. Dolittle is not the least bit comfortable around animals.  When Dr. Dolittle has to catch daughter Maya's (Pratt) guinea pig, he holds it in a folded pillow so he doesn't have to touch it.  (Having similar feelings about pets, I was amused by Dr. Dolittle's behavior around animals.)  What's funny about this is, apparently Murphy wasn't acting.  But this all added up to a fun movie.  I recommend it.",7
942,"Not great, but personally, I found it funnier than I thought I would","This version of ""Doctor Dolittle"" came into stores back when I was twelve years old, which was when I first saw it. I think I liked it a lot at the time, and watched it again a few months later. After many years, I just decided to check it out again. Since I'm obviously not as easily amused as I was when I was twelve, and was aware that it generally wasn't considered that great, I didn't have very high expectations. Afterwards, however, I certainly can't say that I think it's as bad as some do.During his childhood, John Dolittle talks to animals. It seems that he can understand them, and they can understand him, but when his dad sees this, he thinks it's ridiculous. After John's dog is taken away, he is obviously not happy, and stops talking to animals for a long time. When he grows up, he becomes a physician, and has a wife and two daughters. It seems that Dr. Dolittle's communication with animals is long gone, but one night, after he nearly runs over a dog on the road, he hears it say something! Now, his childhood ability has come back, and soon, he finds many different types of creatures following him around! How will people be able to believe that he actually has this remarkable gift, and that it's not just a mental illness, as one would probably assume?! As you would probably expect, this movie has its fair share of lame jokes (such as a rat farting), and like you've probably already heard, the movie would overall appeal more to kids than anyone else. However, certainly not all of the gags are lame. During my most recent viewing, I wouldn't have been surprised if I had kept a straight face through the entire thing, but that's not what happened. I found no huge laughs in the film, but there were several times when I smiled and snickered. I also found that the story gets suspenseful to some degree towards the end. Eddie Murphy's performance is also a highlight. Some of the voice-overs for the animals are silly, maybe the majority of them, but this isn't much of a problem.For kids, this movie could be very funny, though it is somewhat crude at times, remember the PG-13 rating. So, I don't know how appropriate for kids it is (that's for parents to decide). For adults, and probably adolescents, this version of ""Doctor Dolittle"" is certainly nothing special. It could be mildly amusing, if you don't mind extreme silliness and crude toilet humour, but there's probably also a fair chance that you would find it absolutely revolting (I think some clearly have). Without a doubt, this movie is pretty cheesy, and skipping it wouldn't be a great loss for most people, but it's certainly not one that I advise everyone to avoid at all costs (though that would probably be a good idea for some people).",6
943,Funny and Nearly Wholesome,"Doctor Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) could talk to animals as a child. After being deemed crazy by his father and other adults, he effectively shut down his ability. Then one day, as an adult with a successful medical practice, he regained his ability to talk to animals. This ""ability"" was more like a nuisance as it only caused him again to look crazy.I thought the movie was refreshingly light and thereby enjoyable. There was no relationship drama and no petulant teenagers needing to be reformed. His daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone) was a bit of a wildcard, but it was nothing that dominated the plot, plus it was funny. Even with other things going on like a potential buyout from a wealthy company, and his family, it was still about the animals. We were treated to the voices of Chris Rock, Norm MacDonald, Chris Rock, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Julie Kavner (Marge from The Simpsons), Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, and Gilbert Gottfried. They all contributed and they were all amusing.",7
944,He Talks With The Animals.....,"I've always thought Eddie Murphy did comedy better than action, but now I have to add honesty and integrity to his repetoire. He does such a wonderful family film here that it's almost hard to believe he got his start on Saturday Night Live. The mere concept of talking with the animals is created quite believably in the film even though you have to consider the detail that would go into such a feat actually existing. Considering the sheer diversity of the animal kingdom and the limited scope of animals to rationalize, Murphy as Dolittle would have to have considerable telepathic and clairvoyant prowess as well the data-crunching power of a computer in order to decipher instantly the motivations and inclinations of two to three animals at one time as well as come up with the human equivalent of the animal's personality. The concept of animals conversing inter-species wise would have to involve some sort of Mother Earth Theory that all animals wild and domesticated are linked by a central innate consciousness. That said, this movie is quite enjoyable despite the theories and examination it entails. Actress Kristen Wilson as Murphy's wife is a very lovely presence to the movie and former child actress Raven-Symone is becoming a lovely young actress herself far removed from that annoyingly unbearable kid she played on The Cosby Show. The rest of the cast are second stringers to the animal cast whose voices are brought to life by the vocal talents of Norm MacDonald, Julie Kavner, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Jenna Elfman, Gilbert Gottfried and sounding eerily like James Belushi, Albert Brooks. This is one wonderful movie that belongs in your video collection at home.",8
945,An average Kids film,This is really an everage run of the mill kids movie based losely on the the Doctor Dolittle film. Eddie Murphy plays the doctor who finds that he can comminicate with all animals.This leads to every type of animal coming to him for help for their medical problems. The Special affects are not very special but i'm sure a lot of kids would love this film. There are a few funny one liners that will go straight over childrens heads and that are quite funny but all in all this film is just plain OK. 6 out of 10.,6
946,"Good, but not great!","Dr.Dolittle is a nice family movie, but I would not recommend this to people expecting something hilarious like Big Daddy. Dr. Dolittle, played by Eddie Murphy, is a doctor who can hear the voices of animals. Eventually, he becomes a animal doctor and he must save a few animals. Overall, this film is not really funny, but it had a few laughs. The idea(or remake)of this film was great. The acting was good, but not great. Eddie Murphy was alright, but Chris Rock rocked as the guinea pig. There is no original music score, but there are a couple upbeat songs. The only reason I saw this film because I saw the sequel to the film before this. There were only a couple major disappointments, but not many. I rate this film a 7/10.",7
947,A childhood favourite of mine,"Doctor Dolittle is a 1998 family comedy starring Eddie Murphy who plays the title charcther who isn't like many doctors as he can talk to them since they can talk to him. He later befriends a dog named Lucky and his wife Lisa(Kirsten Wilson) thinks his nuts due to his gift with talking to animals at a young age.
Will anyone believe him?Overall I always enjoyed this film having been a fan of Eddie Murphy since I was a kid and no matter what film he is in he always cracks me up Like Jim Carrey and the late Robin Williams. If Like me you love animals then this is for you. Very underrated film.",8
948,Very cute modern take,"My advice is to start with the Eddie Murphy version of Doctor Dolittle. If you've missed all seven movie versions of the classic books, start with 1998. It's very different than the 1967 classic, and if you start with that one, you don't stand a chance at enjoying the modern version. This one takes place in 1998 San Francisco, rather than 1850s England, and it's not a musical. Nor does Eddie Murphy travel the world in search of a rare pink seasnail. Instead of being a linguist who's mastered over 400 animal languages, all the animals communicate with him in English.But it's very, very funny! The premise, though different than the original, is just as interesting. Eddie talked to his dog as a child, but learned to tamp down his talent when his father, Ossie Davis, shamed him. Decades later, with a wife and children of his own, he hears the voice of a dog who he almost crashed into on the road. He realizes his talent has resurfaced, and he struggles with accepting it. He can help animals, and because he's a medical doctor, he can even heal them. Just imagine how wonderful it would be if veterinarians could actually talk to their patients.A side plot involves the merger of Eddie's medical practice, with business partners Oliver Platt and Richard Schiff, to a larger conglomerate. Also, because Eddie tries to hide his dialogues, when he does occasionally get overheard talking to monkeys or rats, people think he's crazy! It's a very funny take on the original story that can be accessible to modern audiences, and with one added bonus: voice cameos. Tons of celebrities voice the different animals, and with no opening credits, you're left to guess who they are until the very end - it's great fun!DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Eddie Murphy drives with the guinea pig in the beginning of the movie, it shows the animal's POV for a few seconds. Also, when Lucky first gets taken into the vet's office, his POV is shown for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",8
949,Love the shellfish....,"John Dolittle has a beautiful wife at his side, two adorable daughters and a career that could not go better. One night, he runs over a dog with his car. The dog yells at him and disappears. From then on, his ability is back, communicating with animals. Soon, animals flock to his place to get medical advice. But his colleagues suspect he's going mad, and as the clinic he works for is being taken over for a huge amount of money, many decisions have to be made.....Murphy had a career resurgence with The Nutty Professor, so this is pay dirt for him and the film makers to remake another beloved classic with a little bit of innuendo and the classic Murphy schtick, but make it a little more icky this time.And the results are really mixed.On the one hand, Murphy is his usual watchable self, and the animals are funny for a little while.The big problem is the script, animals can only be funny if they have something funny to say, and the majority of the time they don't, so we have to rely on silly accents or Chris Rock being over the top and shouting to give us chuckles, and it wears thin very soon.This also marks the point in Murphys career where he just went straight for family fodder, so I theory, its to blame for the non swearing Murphy we get now.For kids under eight, it'll be the funniest thing ever, for others, not so much...",5
950,Comedy Re-Makes Sure Have Gone Down The Dumper: Exhibit A,"Here we go again: Hollywood ""modernizing"" a comedy by adding tons of sleaze to a nice story and a film that was first made 30 years prior to this. There is no excuse for all the inappropriate words and sexual innuendos that are in this ""family film."" Give me a break! That fact that it's rated PG-13 ought to tell you something.Comedy is about the only genre of film making that I think has gone way downhill since the classic era. It's like the stand-up comics: we've gone from clean, clever material to raunchy.The fact that Eddie Murphy and (the voice of) Chris Rock play major roles kind of give you a hint of where this film goes morally. This is a famous kids story and I'm sure many parents took their children to see this film....and were totally embarrassed. If it was advertised as an adult movie: fine, I would have no problems with it. But that's not the case, and so it's a disgusting sham, typical of low-life Hollywood.In addition to the onslaught of language (which includes Jesus's name in vain three times among the other offenses) and fecal matter/fart jokes, the film basically wasn't that funny to begin with It's also not a shock, either, when you discover that Betty Thomas directed this film. This is the same woman who the year before directed ""Private Parts,"" the story of shock jock Howard Stern. As another reviewer aptly put it, ""Come back, Rex Harrison. All is forgiven!""",1
951,animals steal the show,"eddie murphy is incredibly funny again. the animals are funnier still. infact the whole thing is so believable and has the magical quality that makes a kids' movie so endearign.so why the low rating? cos its so very crude!!! too crude for a kids & family movie. even when u laugh, u feel guilty about it, esp. when kids are around.heres a good story gone bad, sadly part 2 is worse. would have been a brilliant movie in the hands of disney.maybe disney should be given the monopoly on kids' movies on a platter. or maybe along with dreamworks, theyve been real good too, so far :) 20th century fox should stick catering to adults.an average 5",5
952,Eddie Murphy talks to the Animals,"Eddie Murphy is a classic and this movie is just so him: he is fast talking animals and other people trying to convince them that he is not mad even though he is talking to animals. He looks a little more mature and less deceitful in this movie than in others such as A Distinguished Gentlemen and Beverly Hills Cop. Though he is a fast talking genius, he is quite respectable in this movie.Basically this movie is about a man who can speak to animals. The plot is thin but the comedy is what makes this movie. It is full of sexual innuendos and simply cute animals that love to talk back to him, especially the rats. There are is lot of dirty, toilet humour, jokes which are suitable for kids for this movie is marketed as a kids movie. Dr Dolittle comes from children's' books I read when I was young and thus it is a kids movie, but the existence of Eddie Murphy makes it very much an adults movie as well. Eddie Murphy has his legions of fans and I he definitely does not disappoint in this movie.Though this is a great movie, there is little depth to it. This does not mean that it is flawed in that way for not all movies need depth. This is not a feel good movie, nor is it satirical, it is simply an Eddie Murphy comic routine. One thing I wondered though is if the Pushme-Pullyou would be in the movie (for those who do not know, the Pushme-Pullyou if a two headed Llama with its second head where its butt should be). It makes a cameo appearance walking behind Dr Dolittle and you see its reflection in the mirror. It is not a major part of the movie, and I don't think it is meant to be. All I can remember of the old books is that Dolittle had a legion of animal followers, and he wasn't Negro. That is not important, but I doubt the movie would have been any good if any other actor had played the part of Dr Dolittle.",7
953,Mildly Silly Fun,"While this is not an ""awesome"" movie, it IS entertaining and clean enough for the whole family. Eddie Murphy's declining career not withstanding, this is actually fun to watch. Although this work falls far from the Beverly Hills Cop tree, and does not quite match the quality of any of his pre-1995 films, it still holds some entertainment value, however mild it may be.It is a modernized version, of course, of Rex Harrison's 1967 classic, but without the charm, the sophistication, or the talent. Unfortunately, while this remake is fun, it is only mildly so, and really quite silly in a wholly unimaginative kind of way. Frankly, the best bit was Norm MacDonald's ""Lucky"" voice part. Eddie Murphy's best post-1995 roles have been voice parts, in my opinion (Donkey & Mushu).The young actresses who play Murphy's daughters are great in their own rights; Raven-Symone and Kyla Pratt, the latter of which continues on with this franchise long after the rest have bailed, creating a nice outlet for her own growing talents. Check them out.All in all, this is fun, if only mildly so, and totally silly. The kids will love it.It rates a 5.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",6
954,"GREAT HARMLESS FAMILY FUN, I HAVE NICE MEMORIES OF THIS FILM","I love Eddie Murphy, that's my first thing & i grew up watching him like i did lots of other favourite actors of mine & i adore his Nutty professor films & The Golden Child & Trading Places & his Beverley Hills Cop Trilogy & his 48 hours films & many more, the guy is a Comic genius & a movie legend, he's been making me laugh for years now!!!
Now after his glory days of the 80's & abit into the 90's he started heading into more family friendly films & that was fine as he made some feelgood gems that are still loved today & as an adult with kids myself i appreciate his ""Family Films"" even more so.
His family flicks are The Nutty Professor 1&2, Dr.Dolittle 1&2, I Spy, Daddy Day Care, the Shrek films, Meet Dave, Norbit & The Haunted Mansion.
Eddie Murphy has been a busy man his films were always hits at the Cinema especially his ""Kid Friendly"" films & one of his biggest hits was the first great fantastic Comedy ""Dr. Doolittle"" & i can see why, i loved this during the 90's & watched it over & over on video like i did the Great Nutty professor films, so i have nice memories & Nostalgia for Dr.Dolittle & remember watching it on video in my room alot.
Here Murphy plays a Doctor who can hear Animals talk & it's a gift he had when he was little but lost contact with it until much later in his professional adult life when he accidentally nearly runs over a dog. It's a fun fantasy set-up for some hilarious scenes with a panicking Murphy & his trying to ignore it all, this is simply a harmless feelgood Comedy than anyone can enjoy, i always loved Eddie Murphy here in his role as the stressed out family man who is coming to terms with his Gift, it's very funny at times & has a genuinely nice & Happy feel to the whole film, it's a friendly feelgood flick that is entertaining & very re-watchable even as an adult!!!
There's lots of fun Animals & recognisable voices & there's that very 90's look & feel that i love as i grew up in the 90s.Just because we grow up it doesn't mean we have to leave behind the Happy fantasy worlds we used to visit often.
In an often dark & scary world it's nice to watch something sweet & fun.",8
955,"For the First time, A Hindi Dubbed Version takes over the English","First of all, Let me tell you I am writing this review for the Hindi Dubbed Version, so if you watch the English one, this review is of no use....Man, I never remembered laughing this much in a family Hollywood movie Dubbed in Hindi. In fact the Hindi version takes over the English one. Hats off to the Dubbing Artists, they gave the animal character's voices to different mimicry artist which brings a stupendously funny feeling for the movie..., So if you understand Hindi, then a must watch for the whole family, no explicit content or cheap jokes either, the artists that made the animals speak, the translators adding extra efforts to the dubbings brought it to life, my review, A Must Watch if you understand Hindi and knows Bollywood......",8
956,Dr. Murphy,"Eddie Murphy was hilarious in this movie,, I like the little back-story where they show how he learned to talk to the animals when he was a little kid. all of the animal characters were just delightful. like the idea of the little camping trip and stuff for him to get away from it all and try to think things thru. he has to convince his family that he is not totally crazy, at first he doesn't wanna believe that he can actually talk to animals, and for the longest time he tries to deny it.. but as the film slowly progresses he has a special gift, and that he can help animals especially when they are sick and need medical attention.. this is a great movie from Walt Disney, and they seem to be getting better and better every time a new one comes out.",6
957,"Initially avoided this movie, but when I watched it I felt like an idiot.","To start off this review I'd like to say that before I ever watched this movie I had the opinion that it was going to be rubbish, solely because of how blown up the movie was. Everywhere I went it was ""The Greatest Showman"". I thought that perhaps it would be a mediocre film at best, blown out of proportion by a craze.Boy was I wrong. Even at the beginning of the movie you are thrown straight into the extravagance of what the movie was about to become. What is basically the story of a simple man becoming a legend in the show-business, is the most flamboyant and breath-taken musical movie I've seen. The soundtrack for this movie is beyond brilliant. Having been impressed by Hugh Jackman's vocals in Les Miserable I was not surprised he pulls it out of the bag in this movie yet again. But Zac Efron really stood out in this movie and that truly surprised me.When you finish this movie you will have the great songs stuck in your head, and you will be fully satisfied having finished the movie, your next plan will likely be getting the soundtrack and reliving the magic all over again.",8
958,This is ... me/you/it,"I'm not a fan of musicals in general. Really I mostly can't see their appeal, but from time to time, I do find myself really enjoying one of them, especially if they are as well done as this. And the mid piece/song ""This is me"" is so good .. excellent! Superb! Any other great word you can think of. I had goosebumps listening to it.Every song has its purpose (still of course you can question the why people would start just sing and dance as if they had choreographed it in advance - well they have, but you know what I mean) and it works. Be it the comedy numbers (Hugh and Zac in one instance in a bar just to name one example) or as dramatic pieces. Hugh has so much fun it transcends the screen ... if you are way worse with Musicals than me, maybe don't watch it .. otherwise give it a shot! But most definitely do listen to the song ""This is me"" ... phenomenal!",9
959,Better than I expected.,This was the perfect family night movie. I loved the music although at first I thought it would be annoying. I enjoyed the scenes and the costumes and everything about this magical film. I would definitely watch it again.,8
960,Hugh Jackman Singing and Dancing. Need I say more?,"I have watched this film approximately twenty or more times. That is in no way an exaggeration and I may be low-calling it. Sometimes, I just have it on in the background while I work out or in the morning or while getting ready for work or I play it while cooking in the evening. On a couple of occasions, I've even caught my boyfriend humming the tunes. To say the songs stick with you, is an understatement. In fact, we've listened and watched it so much, that on every 20th Century Fox Movie ""opening"" sequence on any and all other subsequent 20th Century Fox movies we've watched, I automatically think of this one, and I am half expecting to see and hear the ""Ah, ah, ahhh, ahh ..."" and Hugh Jackman with his low ""Ladies and Gents . . . "". 
 
Besides having a catchy and moving soundtrack, the film itself is a wonder to look at. The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are well-done, and again, come on: HUGH JACKMAN singing and dancing. What could be better? Well, for one, not better, but almost as great, is Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lind. The lady is gorgeous, and while she actually doesn't sing her rendition of ""Never Enough"" (Loren Allred does), the passion and zeal she brings to her onstage performance, is one for the books. I could literally (and have) replay that one scene over and over. Zac Efron and Hugh Jackman also have a duet which is fun and witty and very creatively done. The only reason I did not give it a ""10"", is probably an unpopular view, and I know I will amass a hugh (not a typo :)) number of thumbs down, but oh well: I did not care for Zendaya AT ALL. I think she was so very miscast. I do not think she looked pretty in the film (although after filming, I saw her giving a couple of interviews and she looked beautiful); I thought she had absolutely zero chemistry with Zac Efron; and lastly, both her acting and her voice are like chalk grating on a blackboard to me. I think Logan Browning would have been cuter in the role. That's just me though, although it did affect my thoughts on the film and my score.All in all, WATCH IT if you have not yet done so. It is beautiful to look at and a (modern) masterpiece to the ears.",8
961,Viewers get drawn in,"Viewers are hooked from the opening moment with its power ballads and Hugh Jackman in profile, and drawn into this amazing and wonderful journey.",10
962,Don't go to deep,"Just watch and enjoy it, it's fun and that's what I want In times like these, and my kids love it!",10
963,Surpassed My Expectations,"This is possibly one of the best films I have ever seen in this genre.
From the start to finish, I felt that there was some inaudible and invisible metronome setting the overall pace of the film, a consistent rhythm within many rhythms, if that makes sense. Everything about this film had perfect timing. Editing was seamless. Attention to detail was mind blowing, costumes outstanding. Special effects... whoa. Acting was flawless. I really can't find anything to criticize. 
To summarize in a sentence, first class family entertainment.",10
964,A Musical for the Masses,"It's hard to come up with something that hasn't already been said. Are critics are wrong? Yes. Does it have great music? Absolutely. Will you want to watch it again and again? Almost certainly. The entire cast does phenomenally well singing and dancing and for many, this achievement will be the first line in their biographies. It's a musical that is generally inspiring and evokes good feelings, but still takes you on an emotional journey. It's far from a documentary on P.T. Barnum, but that's not it's purpose. As someone obsessed with Hamilton to the point where I listened to the soundtrack everyday for 2 years before seeing it live on Broadway, I avoided watching this one because I just assumed it couldn't even come close. I was wrong. I'm not saying it's better than Hamilton or even as good because I don't think anything will ever be, but The Greatest Showman is definitely a modern classic that earns a place on the list of must-see musicals. Despite its 19th century setting, the songs are fresh, modern, up-beat numbers that can only be described as instant classics. Just try NOT singing along, I dare you. This is not an old school musical like West Side Story or The Sound of Music; it's very modern in the best sense of the word. The choreography and dancing are also first rate and the movie engages you and sweeps you along so well that by the end, you won't even believe it's been an hour and forty-five minutes. I could watch this weekly and never tire of it. Rather than the critics, trust the viewer reviews, the box office numbers, and the fact that it stayed popular in theaters for so long, they had to forcibly pull it before it's popularity waned because the DVD was about to drop and the streaming deals were about to kick in. If you've ever seen a single musical you liked, you're sure to love this one. If you've never enjoyed a musical before, the. this may be the one to bring you into the fold.",9
965,A Unique Presentation Befitting Barnum Himself,"The success of ""La La Land"" opened Hollywood up to the musical again, and ""The Greatest Showman"" is able to take full advantage. While traditionally the story of P.T. Barnum would be told as a biopic, here it is given a flourish that perhaps the old ringmaster himself would appreciate.For a basic plot summary, ""Greatest Showman"" tells the story of how P.T. Barnum (Hugh Jackman) built his circus empire. This was largely accomplished by using ""freaks"" (bearded lady, dog-faced boy, etc.) to draw curiosity to his museum and later shows. Though initially deemed as catering to the ""lowest common denominator"", Barnum's shows eventually won over the hearts of people (especially children) around the world. Also focused on in this flick is Barnum's marriage to Charity (Michelle Williams) and partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron).By positioning itself in the way that it does, ""Greatest Showman"" only deflects any criticism that can be thrown at it. Not entirely indicative of Barnum's life? The man himself would revel in the drama! Too over-the-top or schmaltzy? Have you ever been to the circus?! In this sense, the film is practically immune to harsh takes.In terms of execution, the music is wonderful and the visuals are stunning and always offering something new. The tone is a good mix between relentless energy, but also being able to slow down and appreciate the softer moments when needed. The ability to accomplish this makes for high emotion with every song.The cast is about as diverse as a circus show itself, what with the eclectic mix of Jackman, Williams Efron, Zendaya, & Rebecca Ferguson. They all perform very well and create a great chemistry on the screen.Personally, ""Greatest Showman"" will never be among my favorite films of all-time. I actually prefer a more straightforward, character-drama biopic approach. However, I can very easily see the appeal of the musical tact here, and enjoyed it enjoy to be thoroughly entertained. If you are more open to this crazier approach than I, the star ranking will likely tick even higher.",7
966,"Move over 'la la land', this is how you musical.","Now THIS is how you do a film! What an epic masterpiece! I don't understand the critics criticism of the lack of a story. There was A very clear cut journey of barnum's desire to be accepted and then learning what is really important in life. All the songs were so catchy, and more our importantly, inspirational. They had something to say. Makes me sad to see so many missed the message of this very important movie, just because it was wrapped up in a fun experience. Can't say enough good things about this film. It's just fantastic. Our audience clapped at the end.",10
967,One of the best movies I've ever seen,"Absolutely beautiful movie. Visually stunning, fantastic acting, songs you'll keep singing for months after. And the songs are catchy without being cheesy. Love the choreography as well. You can't sit still while watching this movie!
The story is very interesting and moving, and the issues they face are still relevant today which makes it very relatable. I've watched it three times and it makes me well up every time, my husband as well.
If you haven't seen it yet, go see it! Even if you're not normally into musicals, I'd still give it a chance :)",10
968,A great show,"Love musicals, always have from a very young age seeing the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'West Side Story', 'The Sound of Music', 'Calamity Jane', 'Singin in the Rain' and Disney musicals. So there is absolutely no bias against musicals, though there are bad ones out there and ones that are still enjoyable or mixed where stories, scripts or both are not strong suits. Went to see 'The Greatest Showman' yesterday with my sister, having been blown away by the trailer (one of the best of the year to me). Both of us found ourselves loving it, it actually is one of my favourites of the year and loved it just as much as 'La La Land'. Like was said with another 2017 favourite 'Paddington 2' it was a breath of fresh air after a variable year seeing my fair share of overblown big-budget blockbusters with little soul, films that waste great premises and films that attempted laugh-a-minute laughs and doing it in a way that came at the expense of heart as well of course some gems. Am not sure where the critic bashing (which has been blown out of proportion for some time now for a lot of films, acclaimed and panned, and is getting incredibly annoying and abused) is coming from. Despite the low Metacritic score and the average one for Rotten Tomatoes, actually personally have seen a lot of positive reviews and word of mouth even from people hard to please.Is 'The Greatest Showman' perfect? Not quite. Some secondary roles are sketchy at best and only serve as ones getting in the way of the troupe overcoming obstacles and adversity and providing conflict. A few of the dramatic parts, like the fire, veer on the slightly melodramatic. Those are my only real complaints.Anybody who has heard of Jenny Lind will need to suspend disbelief at how she would never have sung like she does here. No record survives of her singing (apart from a rumoured cylinder recording, recordings that often didn't do justice to singing voices, particularly in later life and when they were past prime, and nothing like how they are documented as), but from what has been read about her personally her vocal production and technique is too perfect for a voice that has been described as an acquired taste voice despite immense popularity and admiration. Can overlook that, because ""Never Enough"" was so brilliantly performed and it is hard to match what Jenny Lind sounded like when you don't have the audible evidence and only have documentation on critical reception to go by. 'The Greatest Showman' is also not that sort of film to do that.Honestly feel however that the historical inaccuracy, as a biographical drama 'The Greatest Showman' is heavily fictionalised, can, and should be, easily ignored. It is so easy to be captivated by the incredible dazzle and delights of the spectacle, and not many 2017 films left me feeling charmed, with my heart fully warmed, fully entertained, uplifted and with tears welling up in my eyes. 'The Greatest Showman' did all those things, from as early as ""A Million Dreams"" and never let go.'The Greatest Showman' looks amazing, one of the best-looking films of the year. It is one vibrant and classy shot and frame after another, the colours are eye-popping without ever being garish or exhausting and the period detail is as sumptuous as they come. The editing is dazzling and if this is a directorial feature film debut honestly can't wait to see where 'Michael Gracey's directing career takes him.Was wholly captivated by the song and dance numbers. To me the songs were truly infectious and catchy. ""A Million Dreams"", ""Never Enough"" and ""This is Me"" are the particularly memorable standouts. The choreography is a sheer delight in its energy, class and verve, ""This Is Me"", ""From Now On"" and ""Rewrite the Stars"" are just jaw-dropping. The cast do them justice. Vocally, Loren Alfred in ""Never Enough"" and Keala Settle in ""This Is Me"" are brilliant and the aforementioned songs for the choreography are especially well danced.Personally don't agree that 'The Greatest Showman' lacks substance or that the dramatic parts are empty. Sure the more dramatic sections are not as memorable, as well done or as entertaining as the song and dance numbers. Some of it is melodramatic. However the family scenes do have a lot of heart and charm, are sympathetically and touchingly played and the girls are adorable. The themes and values are not hammered home too much and are relevant and as relatable today as they were then. Couldn't have asked for better performances, especially the pitch-perfect one of Hugh Jackman, showing that he is fully at ease in musicals as he is as Wolverine. Despite loving him as Valjean in 'Les Miserables', the role of P. T. Barnum suits him much better particularly in the singing, he sounds incredible with a more even and attractive tone. He is as light-on-his-feet as the great dancers of the Golden Age classic musicals were (capturing the spirit of this era was another thing 'The Greatest Showman' excelled at) and he handles the dramatic/family moments with nuance. Zac Efron not only sounds wonderful and dances a dream (especially in ""Rewrite the Stars"") but shows that he can act, he has come on such a long way and this is the direction he should be taking. Michelle Williams is sympathetic and touching and Rebecca Ferguson is every inch the operatic diva. Keala Settle and Zendaya are especially good of the troupe and the singing voice of young Barnum is beautiful. Overall, really is a great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9
969,Created IMDB account so I can write FIRST review ever....,"I'm sorry folks but the critics are brain dead, The system is rigged by movie studios paying off these worthless critics to only favor certain movies, they should be ashamed of themselves, hope you can sleep at nights knowing users outnumber your worthless rigged pay off reviews. I'm not a musical type person at all but this movie touched me in every aspect of the movie, I had tingles running down my body and couldn't hold back my tears. If this movie doesn't touch you, then you don't have a heart, period and that's coming from a right wing conservative.This is by far the Greatest movie of 2017....plan on going to see it again. Also, bought the Soundtrack too. Two Thumbs Up.",10
970,Great Fun,"When I saw the first trailer, I thought this would be fun. Then I started reading about it, especially local critics. I'm pretty picky and don't have much time for bad musicals. This pretty much floored me. The songs were pristine. The choreography was creative and fun. The casting worked wonderfully as did the special effects. I'm only taking a point away because it was so utterly contrived. But I thought Jackman and Ephron did yeoman duty as the leads. The circus bits were great. The ""freaks"" were engaging and fun. I wished it had a slightly sharper edge and a little more internal conflict, but the message put forth was just fine. Go see it because it is great fun.",9
971,A Birthday Surprise,"Sunday was my niece's birthday. 16. I invited her and two of her friends to do whatever they wanted. They chose to stay home, eat cake and watch The Greatest Showman on HBO and I thought Oh no. But, I had cake with them and sat to watch this Michael Gracy, who? Michael Gracy to see the story of PT Barnum with Hugh Jackman. Sentimental and pretty, yes but also, engrossing, moving, beautiful and structured in such a way that doesn't fall into the usual biopic traps. It moves at a breathless pace with smart and unexpected transitions. Hugh Jackman is great and Michelle Williams truthful to a fault. She's never less than that. What a wonderful actress. Zac Effron gives, what it may very well be, his most convincing performance and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson was a revelation to me. The script by Jenny Bicks and the remarkable Bill Condon tells a classic tale with contemporary rhythms and contemporary pace. Needless to say, I enjoyed it much more that I could possibly had imagine. So, thank you Lilli, happy 16!",7
972,"As Soon As It Was Over, I Wanted to See It Again","I love the circus. I love quality cinema. Not since Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) has a motion picture so successfully combined these two elements. I wouldn't be surprised if it won the same awards as Cecil B. DeMille's The Greatest Show on Earth (1952). Michael Gracey skillfully brought together the best music, choreography, cast, cinematography, visual effects, costumes, and set decoration I have seen in recent years, all fresh and original, and integrated them into nothing short of a masterpiece.",10
973,A-W-E-S-O-M-E,"I'm so mad at myself for not watching this movie sooner!!! I could've been enjoying it for the past six months!!!We watched it as a family; two 40-somethings, a 4 year old, and a 3 year. We ALL loved it!!! The kids were singing along and dancing. My husband, who hates musicals, LOVED it! We watched it six times in three days!!!This is the epitome of a feel-good movie!!!Don't waste another day not having seen this gem!!!!",10
974,Listen,Take this as a film not as historic correctness. The guy in real life was not nice. I also thought the alpino girls were brilliant. Should of had a bigger part,10
975,"Not a masterpiece, but brilliant and a must watch","If you're a fan of musicals, get out your tissues, because this movie will have you crying ugly tears of joy. The real genius of The Greatest Showman, however, is the very currently relevant themes of diversity and class.In P.T. Barnum's day, class was something one was born into, with no escape, though the idea of class mobility was on the rise, thanks to the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment. After the French and American revolutions, culture was on it's way to modern democracies. This movie is a nod to how entertainment began to reflect these changes. Today, classical entertainment like ballet and theater combines with the liberal and diverse entertainment of fringe ideas like the circus, to make what we consider modern entertainment, movies and television.We don't quite take for granted the diversity and acceptance we enjoy in our contemporary world (evident in ongoing racism and other discrimination like against LGBTQ people), but we are still a world away from the 19th century. But, Barnum was clearly ahead of his time, thanks to being an upwardly mobile individual himself (a rarity for the time), and having a bold and somewhat narcissistic personality.I think what is most striking about this story in this moment in history is that Barnum embraced and promoted an inevitable cultural phenomenon, even though he himself might not have been fully aware of its impact. His main motivation, after all, was to be a legitimate upper class person, not to unite the masses. He was simply a vessel through which that occurred. But, what happened with the circus in his time was really a precursor to what today is civil rights and modern democracy.",8
976,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!,"It has been SO long since a movie/musical made me feel so...HAPPY!
This movie is absolutely FANTASTIC! Everything from the incredible, toe-tapping, music to the heartfelt, dream-filled, story-line! I was so immersed in the movie that at some point I totally forgot I was sitting in a packed theater on Christmas Night! I'll even admit that I broke the cardinal rule and actually turned on my cell phone to download the the ENTIRE soundtrack while still in the theater...and I was only two songs in!! I will also admit that I am a 42yr old who left that theater feeling like a little kid again, wishing that I can twirl my way to the car without being looked at as crazy! LOL!! I've already seen it twice in as many days, and I plan on seeing it TONS more until I can own it for myself! It is DEFINITELY a movie that you have to experience in a theater though, so PLEASE ignore the snub-nosed critics and go see this magical film! You won't regret it!",10
977,Good Choreography but Sloppy Story,"A musical movie about P.T. Barnum told with all great reverence to P.T. Barnum, featuring P.T. Barnum's Museum of Curiosities...so why not just make ""Barnum"" the stage musical? The answer to that question seems to be because then they couldn't get the guys from La La Land to do the music; fair enough. But if director Michael Gracey and screenwriter Jenny Bicks were set on custom making this celebration of glitz, chicanery and humbug they could have at least opted for a little more connective tissue.The Greatest Showman is a movie in moments, many of them great many more of them flaccid and empty. We're whisked through P.T.'s (Jackman) impoverished childhood in a single bound before settling on his happy marriage with wife Charity (Williams), and his two daughters (Johnson and Seely) who have grown to see their father as a hero. Tired of working to scrounge up a meager living, Barnum embarks on a risky entertainment venture and in due time, recruits his circus of curiosities and freaks.From that point on, the film's narrative relies heavily on its skin-deep celebration of acceptance and diversity. This is while it chugs along through Barnum's life from his start as a full-time huckster, to his falling out with Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (Ferguson). And while it would have been nice to say that the movie does a good job of linking theme with plot, I'm sorry to say none of it becomes a cohesive whole.This is not entirely the fault of the filmmakers. I mean turning P.T. Barnum's life into a celebration of kindness and humanity is like using William 'Boss' Tweed as a symbol for New York pride. This film being a musical, I was not expecting something exacting, but I was expecting at the very least a keen acknowledgement that the legacy of P.T. Barnum isn't all razzle-dazzle. Yet this film makes him out to look like a saint; a man of untold potential who uses ""truthful hyperbole"" to provide for his loving family - A man of conviction, of love and of just wanting to put a smile on your face.Framed in virtually any other way, Barnum would be the villain - enticing his young protégé Phillip (Efron) to ""live a little,"" and abandon his family to come join the circus. Belittling a theater critic with insults masquerading as flaccid, fortune cookie, self-help wisdom and enticing circus ""freaks"" to stand out and express themselves while closing the door on them the moment he's among the rich and famous. The film's show-stopping tune ""This is Me"" takes place at this moment but because the film is too scared to make its hero anything more complicated than a fancily folded cocktail napkin, the moment feels like the side characters are just letting off steam.What ultimately saves this movie from being a complete waste of a Saturday night is the choreography. Every poppy show tune and love ballad brings with it entire body shots of twirling, leaping perfection, conjuring memories of the physical feats of the cast of West Side Story (1961). Not satisfied with the traditional, the film continues to build its momentum with incredibly fancy footwork and some truly death defying trapeze choreography on the part of Zendaya and Zac Efron.There's imagination in the frame and a lot of it, but largely due to the film's complete inability to marry subject with tone, The Greatest Showman is far from great. Rather than being a worthy successor to Moulin Rouge! (2001) this picture winds up feeling like Newsies (1992) without a Crutchy. And let's face it; the only thing we really remember about that movie was there was a character named Crutchy.",6
978,Brilliant moments but incoherent storytelling,"I truly feel that there was a missed opportunity here with the greatest showman, it had great talent, music, costume design and an overall aura that feels like an extravaganza yet somehow it still falls short.If you have seen the trailer you have likely already seen the film, there were brilliant songs and likeable characters for sure but at the end of the day the storytelling was horrendously lacking. Which is as I have said a terrible shame seeing as there was a brilliant story about acceptance and prejudice right there yet the film never seems to fully capitalize. Much like Barnum's circus was described by the characters in this film this film is definitely likeable but at the end of the day, a cheesy, popcorn shoving flick. This film can also be described as a series of single moments of brilliance, when the film really utilized the musical aspects it really presents these visually stunning scenes yet, outside of those moments this is a very spotty film with an incoherent narrative. Indeed, the film seems to jump from scene to scene, moment to moment without any worthwhile character development or motive and without establishing much story points. While the movie had characters that were physically fleshed out and unique they weren't given much time for characterization except for few individual characters, as a result many of the characters seem more like caricatures then characters with personality and heart, which is something that the film truly needs. It almost seems like because the characters were so individually stylized physically they didn't see a need to narratively build their characters.Then again, those moments and bursts of energy in the film were just so well done that makes the film something that cannot be simply dismissed, a true shame. The greatest showman thrives at depicting the human spirit and tenacity yet fails to deliver a story with a coherent story and focus. But in there somewhere is a great film that sadly was not what the end result was. If the greatest showman could better build to character revelations and the main romance story with meatier character motives that truly connects those individually great moments I believe we do have something great here.",5
979,A sugar rush,"Quite a frustrating film. The musical numbers are far and away its strongest attribute, which is obviously what any good musical should strive for. Although they aren't all showstoppers, there are some genuinely excellent sequences with tight, kinetic editing, great rhythmic camera movements, and vibrant choreography. The first proper musical number that acts as a prologue to Barnum's life was quite impressive with its fluid execution and ability to convey a large amount of information in a short period of time (which ironically is a quality that ends up being to the film's detriment when viewed as a whole... more on that later). Jackman's and Efron's bar duet is another fun and energetic sequence with a lot of cool camerawork and infectious energy. Essentially all of the songs are pleasant, catchy, and memorable as well, if a bit vanilla.The strength of these musical sequences is enough to save the film from being bad, and is even almost enough to outweigh the many, many flaws... but not quite. Firstly, the film is attractive to look at to be sure, but it is at times so incredibly glossy that it feels like you're watching a shampoo or jewelry commercial. Sure, it's going for that fairy tale feel, but at times the sheen and shimmer is a little too blinding. And that high-gloss polish is a symptom of a much deeper problem: the incredibly superficial quality of the story and its characters. It's disappointing because this story is genuinely interesting and has the potential for a lot of moral exploration that is completely passed over. Again, I get that this is a musical and a family film, but that doesn't mean it has to be vapid and stupid (see: La La Land). I found it extremely troubling that the film completely ignored the moral quandary of whether Barnum was helping these ""unique"" people, or exploiting them for his own fame and fortune. These characters never even question his intent, viewing the situation as Barnum helping to ""put them out there"", gain them social acceptance, and create a ""family"", where in reality they're quite clearly being taken advantage of in a way that is arguably more reprehensible morally than the protesters who mock them. It's a truly glaring omission from the film that saps so much potential substance from the story.Contributing to the superficial feeling of the film is another all-to common problem that modern American family films suffer from: the pacing is way too fast. It's like the studios are afraid people will be bored by their films, and thus they design them to speed through plot points and character development in a way that ends up suffocating the life from it. Sure this approach makes the film feel lively and exciting, but it also robs it of actual, meaningful character interactions and development. The result is a film that feels like all dessert and no main course - a bowl of chocolate ice cream sure tastes great but it's no substitute for a satiating meal.Another nitpick that bothered me enough that I have to mention it: why is a renowned 19th Century opera singer belting out a Celine Dion-esque pop tune for an adoring ""high brow"" audience in a classic theater? That scene was almost laughable in its absurdity. And although it was by far the worst offender, I would say in general the music in the film, while catchy, did clash somewhat with the period.Honestly, I really should be giving this film a lower score. Somehow I enjoyed it quite a bit even in the face of the many fundamental issues, which is a testament to the strength of the best sequences. Still this is a deeply flawed film that, for all its visual splendor and admittedly intoxicating energy, amounts to little more than a sugar rush.Strong 2.5/5",5
980,Critics are Wrong,"I have never written a movie review but I couldn't let this jewel of a movie be slammed by the cynical critics without saying how much I loved it. This was the perfect movie for our family on Christmas Day. Don't pay attention to the ""professional"" reviews; judge by the moviegoers who are praising the movie. It was moving, upbeat, and romantic. Can't say enough good things about it. Hugh Jackman, Zac Efron, Michelle Williams, and Zendaya are all so talented. Go see it in the theater to really appreciate how magical this movie is.",10
981,"Much style, little substance","The story of PT Barnum, famous for founding Barnum and Bailey Circus and revolutionising entertainment.Much style, little substance. Some of this is to be expected, as you can't have a movie on a showman extraordinaire and one of the most significant figures in entertainment history without a large amount of pizzazz.However, the movie doesn't really give us much of Barnum's history or motivations. The main focus seems to be on cramming as many song and dance numbers into the movie as possible, at the expense of any plot. For every minute of plot or character development you have four minutes of musical numbers.To crown it all, the music is poor and irritating. Every musical number sounds like something from a made-for-kids animated Disney movie, rather than a biopic. The movie is set in the mid-1800s yet we have ultra-contemporary numbers. It is quite jarring and negates any semblance of historical accuracy, credibility or substance.",4
982,What a waste....,"Stop me if you've heard this one before: Mozart, that legendary impresario, had an sibling who actually helped write a lot of his early work, and got precisely no credit for it... due to the sexist society at the time. She was also a brilliant violinist, but was forced to play the harpsichord by her father as the violin 'was no instrument for a lady.' Meanwhile, everyone mooned over her brother, the 'child prodigy', leaving her completely in the shade. In fact, a lot of what she could have achieved she didn't thanks to the patriarchal beliefs back in the 18th century, and by the sound of the epilogue she had a pretty miserable life after she gave up on all her hopes and dreams. Nice.How much of this has a basis in reality I don't know, but I suspect there's a fair bit of airbrushing of history here. What can't be denied though, is this is a well acted drama of family ties and unfulfilled potential, full of wonderful classical music and handsome costumes. This is strictly a placid affair... You're not going to see any fireworks going off, and some people may find it all a bit too stagy. But Nannerl is a captivating lead, and while her story might not be 100% accurate as depicted here, it's well worth investing the nearly two hours to discover it. And isn't that really what matters, at the end of the day? 6/10",6
983,"Wonderful, subtly rich film capturing a heartbreakingly unfulfilled talent","I'm very surprised by the low ratings this film has received, particularly for those who found it boring. To the contrary, I did not want the film to end, intrigued by every twist and turn. I won't recount the plot. Instead, I felt the entire cast was excellent, each subtly, but powerfully, portraying the tensions their character face. In Barbé's Leopold Mozart we see a loving, but ambitious and selfish father, unwilling to challenge the social conventions of his time. In Marie Féret's Nannerl we see a young woman struggling with her desire to express herself and be recognised, but captive to her sense of obedience to the multiple characters to whom she is subordinate, and the challenges of coming-of-age in a domineering family. Her struggles are matched by her melancholy expressions in which even happiness comes at a bittersweet price.There is no over-acting, but instead excellent direction. I don't believe that production values were low, given the costumes, the locations and the excellent cast. Instead I think the director chose to tell a real (although fictionalised) story rather than to glamourise and over-dramatise. The coldness of the European winters was brought to life, and gave the viewer some sense of what it would have been like without modern comforts and luxury for the Mozart family, and matched the sombre and sad story perfectly. I would like to see more films like this.",9
984,Lovely graceful film -- excellent acting,I saw this at the FilmFest DC in April 2011.The story was complex on so many levels: the wonderful family relationship of the Mozarts as they travelled around Europe. The strong feminine influences; the strictures of society that allow the older sister's intellect to waste away; the daughters of the king who were locked away in isolation.The costumes were authentic without being overly lush.The relationship between the young Wolfgang and his older sister was quite touching.The growth of the lead actress from barely a teen to a woman accepting her fate was written (all within a year or so) and acted very well.There was an interesting subplot with the king's daughter that showed the two girls/women accepting the same fate albeit at different levels of society.,9
985,Flat.,"Wolfgang Mozart's older sister was exceptionally talented. And, as she grew, her family discouraged her and put all their energy into her brother and pushed her to marry and have a family. All this is shown in the film and cannot really be refuted. However, the filmmaker's have decided to take some liberties--to ASSUME certain things about Maria Mozart that we simply do not know to be true today. In that sense, it's quite a bit like ""Amadeus""--fictionalizing history a bit here and there. The story has a strong feminist bent--and even goes so far as to attribute much of Wolfgang's talent to her! This is rather dubious, as Wolfgang clearly was insanely gifted. It's an intriguing idea--but there really isn't any basis for this assertion. Now this complete fiction COULD have worked--but the rest of the story is incredibly dull--very, very mannered, slow and lacking anything to hook the viewer. 'What if' just isn't enough to carry the rest of the film and I felt EXTREMELY restless as the film progresses. My butt also fell asleep--and it's a great judge of whether or not a film is too tedious!",5
986,intriguing idea squandered,Léopold Mozart promotes his musical children; Wolfgang and his elder 14 year old daughter Maria Anna 'Nannerl' Mozart (Marie Féret) to the royalties throughout Europe. He tries to restrict Nannerl's musical ambitions in the patriarchal society. She believes she may have contributed to Wolfgang's writing but Léopold dismisses her and forbids her from continuing to write. She befriends the daughters of the King especially Louise. She delivers a letter to Louise's brother Le Dauphin in mourning but she has to be disguised as a man to avoid a scandal. He encourages her to write. She meets him several times but only in disguised. He is conflicted about making her his mistress unwilling to repeat his father's debauchery.This is an intriguing fictional biography. Marie Féret is the director's daughter and mostly fails to energize this costume period piece. The movie is two hours long and requires her to carry it on her shoulders. This has loads of potential for scandal and passion but none of it comes to pass. This does have a quiet beauty but is mostly a squandered opportunity.,5
987,An unfortunate waste of good material,"This could have been a much better movie than it turned out to be. The premise is obvious from almost the very beginning: Mozart's sister Nannerl had talent as a musician and composer, but it was put under a barrel by her domineering father, who chose to devote all his energies to promoting the career of her younger brother, the unquestioned genius WA Mozart. Boring because obvious - unless something interesting had been done with it.And that is the problem with this movie. Nothing was ever really interesting. The characters were almost all shy and retiring. That may be realistic, but it doesn't make for an interesting movie. Remember the very strong characters created in Amadeus, and contrast them with 1) Nannerl Mozart, 2) Mozart and Nannerl's mother, 3) the daughter of Louis XIV who befriends Nannerl, 4) Louis XV, etc. They were all of the shy, retiring type. That doesn't make for a dynamic movie.There are never any great dramatic scenes between Nannerl and her father where she complains about the attention lavished only on her younger brother. Indeed, there is precious little real drama here. Just a lot of shy, unhappy characters caught in their shyness. It's hard to get involved with that.There was nothing wrong with the acting, and everything wrong with the script. It should have been thrown out and replaced with one that created interesting, dynamic characters that made Nannerl's (perhaps) unfair treatment come alive and engage the audience. That didn't happen.The costumes and sets are nice. But if the sound were turned off, you'd miss nothing of interest.",3
988,"Pseudo Biography with ""Period"" Music","It's difficult for me to see a film like this as a professional musician without seeing red at the same time. No, I'm not expecting a slavish rehash of history - far from it -but it wandered so far from reality as to remind me of films such as ""Song to Remember"" with Cornel Wilde swinging through the grapevines and playing the frail, tubercular Chopin at the same time.Leopold Mozart, despite the general feeling that he pushed his children unmercifully, was actually trying to help his children become established in the world and to prevent his son from squandering his money as he was always tempted to do. In fact poor Wolfgang was buried in a pauper's grave after his father died.The music in the film is another bone of contention. Instead of using something from the immense amount of music Wolfgang composed as background, it substituted a fake Classical imitation with romantic harmonies and orchestration that really wasn't good to begin with.As for the ultra-low lighting we associate with ""le film noir' or crime shows currently on television, we had to depend too often on dialog alone to guide us through what was happening. I realize that filming interiors with candles was period but even people sitting next to them were mainly in the dark. I know this is handy for not having to provide full period sets in detail but still I felt cheated.This is a French work, nonetheless, and as so many French films are prone to do, it talks itself to death.Curtis Stotlar",5
989,An interesting film with great cinematic work,"I found ""Mozart's Sister"" on Amazon Prime Video to stream for free. I'm a musician myself of almost a decade playing guitar, bass, and drums. Several years ago in high school I was in an advanced choir that covered some of Mozart's work. Since then I was always fascinated with Mozart. Who was he, why was he such a musical genius? Why did he die so young? The history and sound of Mozart continues to fascinate me and when I seen this film on Amazon Prime, I had to check it out.Mozart's Sister revolves around the story of Nannerl Mozart (Maria Anna Mozart), the older sister of the musical genius that is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Despite my fascination and reading into Mozart, I knew nothing of him having a sister. I watched this film all in French with English subtitles, but that didn't hurt the quality of the film. Mozart's Sister is a great film. The camera work, costumes, music, and the works, all 110% authentic. There are no visible flaws of any kind in the film work.The whole movie revolves around a teenage/young adult Maria Anna Mozart. We get to see how she herself was a magnificent instrumentalist and composer that nearly rivaled her brothers musical abilities. But because of sexism and social status in mid 1700's Europe, she was often pushed aside and disregarded in favor for her brother's work. We also get to see the rest of the Mozart family, Mozart's father who taught them music and his mother.All and all I enjoyed this film. But I will say, it's not for everybody. If you're not into Mozart or his history, foreign films with subtitles, or movies about mid-1700 music, then maybe you should pass. This does feel like something you would watch in a schoolroom more than something you would watch on a Friday night. Also, ""Mozart's Sister"" has it's dull moments at times, and the movie never really evolves into anything more than Marianne's early years. We don't get to see her grow up, go through her brothers death later in life, or anything along those lines. I felt if we got to see more of her older life it would have been more grabbing. Still, good movie, average rating of 7/10, good movie with great cinematic/sound work, good acting, just had a few low points that stopped it from being a great movie.",7
990,Enjoyable period Costume Drama about Mozart Sister,"I found this to be an enjoyable period drama about the Mozart family. Remember it is a French made film, made in French language. Top notch English subtitles are necessary on DVD. I doubt the movie, released in the autumn of 2011, would have got worldwide cinema attraction.Most of us watching would not know the story of Wolfgang Mozarts sister and I have no special interest in classical music, though as a tourist, yes, I did once visit Salzburg.The film centres around the maturity of the young Nanna and her exploitable musical potential while in friendship at least with the French Dauphin.The movie contains too much talking overall and I usually like French movies for that but not this time. I liked the acting and the costume drama and I liked the story itself, though two hours is definitely too long and for a non French speaking audience, not many are going to stay until the end. I nodded off the first time after 30 minutes and gave the film a late afternoon re-viewing earlier this afternoon.Nothing offensive or conspiratorial about the movie. It simply dramatise a story from a book published a few years ago. Enjoy the movie for what it is and do not expect too much.The music does come across as a little false and overdone but 6 from 10 is about right pitch for its rating.",6
991,Interesting & Believable Slice of Mozart Family Live,"I didn't know what to expect with the movie Mozart's Sister, but I was surprised - it was very good - even watching it with subtitles. The movie gives a very believable and intimate picture of father Leopold Mozart's young family - with prodigies Wolfgang at age 11 and older sister Anna Maria (Nannerl) at 14 - and mainly involves their travels seeking musical glory. It has all the stuff you'd expect in a 1760's family including musical practice, family fun and playful laughter, adventures, and also Wolfgang and Nannerl's wish to compose. Good script, well paced and interesting plot, and a focus on Nannerl make this a winner. I might watch it again!My Rank: 8 / 10.",8
992,Boring and student-film like but with better production values,"Half way through this film I started considering it as a student film that had some decent financial backing. The main lead who played Nannerl had little in the way of facial expressions and often stood around like she had been directed to stand around. The actor who played Leopold Mozart, however, was mostly effective in his portrayal of a man who believed in what he was doing, and believed it to be the best for his son and his family. The dialogue (as it was translated) was mostly without much flare, and the music score seemed to fill in the emotional gaps that neither the dialogue nor the acting was putting across. Direction fell flat most of the time with simple side-profile shots. The script itself seemed to give no indication as to where the film itself was going, as though the writer had determined that the basics of Nannerl's life was already known, so all they had to do was write some scenes around that - for me, this script just did not work. The idea that Nannerl was being eclipsed by her brother, though it was present throughout, never felt like a driving force that pushed the film forward and was a constant influence that determined Nannerl's emotions and feelings. As a result, every time a climax (with accompanying string motifs) arrived on screen, the film felt like it was preparing itself to end... and then would go on.This isn't the worst film I've seen, and it wasn't joyless to the point of leaving the cinema; it was just simply quite boring, and non-involving for the viewer (me). I wanted it to end during several climactic moments but it didn't. Definitely far too long at 2 hours.",4
993,An appropriate use of the movie/film medium...,"inasmuch as THIS is what it's good for - amongst the perhaps most obvious one of entertaining - i.e. the ability to take us on a trip through history and meet people within the context of what we know, rounded out with a good writer's imaginationand as a result, make us THINK about what really happened, and/or how it FELT to be the people portrayed, in those days; what other medium can do this as easily, really and truly? I adore film-making for this capacity but it's so often overlooked in the mad rush for box office profits, which puts movies firmly in the money-making Entertainment category, first and foremost, frequently regardless of content, characters, correct costumingSo, I loved this movie and found it completely absorbing, though I'm well aware it won't appeal to 'the masses', basically because it's a quintessentially French ('foreign') film which lacks the overt Drama and character arcs of Hollywood and the colourful characters and quirky story lines of other U.S.A. movies. It's food for thought over food for entertainment (though I WAS entertained in the process, too - but then I possess an old-fashioned attention span of more than 5 minutes, and don't need a car-chase or anything to blow up in order to feel something!) ;) Especially telling were what are most likely the historical truisms; the fact that Nannerl was an older sister who almost certainly DID co-create (if not co-write, as she was refused tuition) her famously talented younger brother's early works, completely uncredited - and this of course is a perennial problem for female artistes everywhere, even today (if it's not their brothers, then for their boyfriends &/or significant otherswho absorb their contributions as natural extensions of themselves, rather than acknowledging them at very least, as addendums given to them as gifts by another person other than themselves), along with the problem of not receiving sufficient support from their fathers for their innate talent, on the basis of being a girl. I really appreciated the fact that the entire problem of gender was shown throughout this film in a genteel and non-bombastic way, by comparisons and conversations void of overtly angry emotions - which, and we so easily tend to forget this fact - were within the context of the society(ies) shown in this particular time & place, INDULGENCES which really & truly only the most powerful (e.g. the Dauphin), could afford to show, far less, vent; we forget, the era of all-out Self-Expression in the West really only arose post-war across all classes & societies. This was not Italy, after all, nor America or Britain in the '60s or '70s+, but chiefly the priories and courts of France, a couple of decades BEFORE the revolution; best behaviour between family members so close-knit as the Mozarts, who for so many years shared such close quarters as coach carriages and bedrooms in the houses of hosts, was likely the norm; feelings festered under the surface because it wasn't safe to fully express them, and then they were complicated - painfully - by deep feelings of love, appreciation, and humility fostered by the awareness of how much humiliation the average person had to put up with during the course of their lives, just to survive; the waiting on a prince for 3 whole weeks while he indulged in excesses they could never afford, wasting this talented family's time, which they would have had to 'swallow' without a whimper, was a very good example. We in our (relative) freedom forget how self-expression is a part of being free - which most people were not. No matter how talented - which evidently, Leopold, Nannerl & little Wolfgang ALL were, back then, talent was the ticket but not the money-maker, per se& women never owned any money anyway, no matter what work they did, nor even who they married. So they were the subjects of men, which feminist point is pointed out succinctly yet never with a big banging of any drums! The fact that Mrs. Mozart adored her talented, forceful and resourceful husband, was a bonus - and later in life, a model unconsciously copied by her famous surviving (remember, these were her only two children who lived, so death was an ever-present reminder to boot in the lives of these people and indeed most of the populace back then) son, but was not necessarily guaranteed in every marriage. The touching small scene of the ill-fated fifteen year old future Marie Antoinette already doting on pleasing her deeply troubled young widowed husband, speaks volumes to this - she was a woman of her time, determined to make the most of her lot in life, ergo, to become a good and dutiful wifesomething which Nannerl simply cannot strive to do till the advanced (back then) age of 32 - and when we watch this movie in it's entirety, even setting aside the imagined/fictitious aspects of her story - we know, why.",9
994,Thirty Minutes In And NOTHING Has Happened!,"My title says it all. I found this movie incredibly boring. I just didn't like it, though I thought the visuals were nice.",4
995,"Intriguing idea, slightly disappointing development","A widely fictionalized story of the Mozart family, focusing on Nannerl, Amadeus' older sister. The fictional events are supposed to take place during the Mozart's ""grand tour"" of Europe, from 1762 to 1773. On their way to Paris, the family gets stranded nearby an abbey, where the last three daughters of King Louis XV are staying. Nannerl makes friend with Louise, the youngest sister and she is entrusted with a love letter for Hugues, a guy Louise is in love with, to be delivered in Versailles.The family arrives in Versailles when the Dauphin is in mourning for the death of his wife and Nannerl must wear men clothes to enter the Dauphin's circle, where Hugues is employed. This leads to the Dauphin and Nannerl falling for each other. But politics must prevail, therefore the Dauphin marries a princess and Nannerl goes back to Austria with her family.The main point of the film is the miserable situation of women at the time. Nannerl was an accomplished performer as her brother, but being female she had no rights to pursue her studies or to have a ""career"" as a musician. - Louise was not even allowed to court and being the younger one, her only ""escape"" was to become a nun. - The Dauphine we do not even see, died in childbirth, a high risk activity at the time and yet, the only added value of a woman's life. - Her death was useless because she produced a female heir, completely useless for the monarchy, hence pushing the Dauphin to a hasty second marriage; etc....Although the romance is purely fictional, what resonates disturbingly true is the submissive, second-rate quality of a woman's life in Mozart times.The movie is slightly too long, with some unnecessary episodes (the porn book?). The costumes and lights are good and most acting, too. I did not like much Marie Féret as Nannerl, because her delivery was very flat – but maybe it was a way to suggest that women could not even express emotions",6
996,"Excellent ""history of music"" story","Yes, the producers made some changes to the actual historical record, but that was mostly to ""fill in the gaps"" by imagining what life was like for Mozart's sister.The academic discipline of history had little interest in the details of ordinary life until the second half of the 20th century, so what we know of the past is limited to what historians considered to be ""important events in the lives of important people."" Mozart's sister like most women of her era was not
""important.""I liked this film and it's music, but I am not very knowledgeable about music, so I can understand the complaints I have read in the other comments. Still, for the non-expert it was wonderful.The saddest scenes for me were of the French princesses locked away in a convent. Women who as little girls dreamed of being a princess should realize that this is a more realistic vision of what life was like for princesses in royal families, not the Disney version.",9
997,Highly recommended,"I enjoyed the movie a lot. I was sad it ended. I enjoyed the clothing, acting, relationships, and the French. There was not much of a plot. The progress of events may not be to the liking of people supporting women empowerment --but again, this is a historical fiction movie.. I picked it because I wanted to listen to some Mozart music, but there were not much of that.The movies gives a unique window to peek at how relationships among members of an immediate family looked like in 18th century France.As always, I enjoy watching characters discover the talents of genius, and there was many such cases in this movie.It is the first time I write a review of a movie here, and ten lines is lots of characters in these days and age!",8
998,Strange futuristic movie resembling Fritz Lang's Metropolis,"I've seen this movie in a festival in Porto, Portugal called Fantasporto. I was amazed because it didn't win a single prize and it was my favorite movie in the festival. It's a strange, curious journey into a black & white world where a town was ravaged by an explosion in a chemical plant and almost everybody lost their memories. A team was assembled to try to reconstruct the lives of all these people and one of the main tools they use is dream analysis. They are baffled by a strange woman who never sleeps but has daydreams of a mystical resistance fighter who has promised to bring down the system. Confusing and extremely beautiful, this movie reminds us of the works of George Orwell, the great Twilight Zone series and the classic Metropolis by Fritz Lang. Unmissable by fans of dark, strange, thought-provoking movies.",9
999,Hauntingly beautiful,"Argentina's cinema is sadly lacking in sci-fi, so I was surprised when I came across this little gem. La Sonámbula (Sleepwalker for foreign audiences) is a showcase of everything good within the genre: political commentary, dystopia landscapes, a complex plot. The subtle nods to giants in the genre are here and there - from technology similar to that seen in Blade Runner to the Orwellian government that the protagonists are intent to escape. Perhaps the weakest points of the movie are the one- dimensional female lead, accentuated by Viruboff's stiff, mechanical performance, and the script, with lines that for an Argentine would seem forced, if a bit outdated.",6
1000,A dream so much long,"The film moves around a very good idea, the dream and the forgetfulness like a way to lose our own identity. But... The movie is so much boring, the excellent effects and artist direction recreating the Buenos Aires of the year 2010 is not enough to involve the spectator who want that movie ends soon. The wonderful end catches all the public between the sleep and the exit door of the cinema.",6
